Eighth-grader Cordelia Longo had a rough day at school this year when she went to a school bathroom and found it did not have a sanitary napkin/tampon machine. She went to another bathroom that did and paid a dime for her feminine protection, but the machine ate her money, the Seattle Times reports.
She tried again at another machine, which also ate her money, before realizing she had a sanitary napkin in her backpack.
The experience apparently convinced her to launch a campaign for free tampons for all, which her school already provided at the nurses office and locker rooms, NBC News reports.
“I just didn’t want other girls to have to experience this. I just wanted to make people’s lives better – girls’ lives easier,” she told the news site. “They already have to deal with so much and this seemed like something I should fix.”
So she started a petition and got 100 people to sign on to demand officials put free tampons in school bathrooms.
She also sent a letter to administrators that outlined why she doesn’t think it’s fair that girls have to pay a “pink tax” to control their periods.
“Why are tissues and toilet paper provided free at school, but not sanitary pads and tampons?” she questioned in the letter. “As toilet paper and tissue are used for normal bodily functions, sanitary pads and tampons are also necessary to address normal bodily functions that happen naturally. The only difference is that only girls need pads. Girls do not choose to have periods. So girls are being penalized and made to pay for a bodily function they cannot control.”
Next, Longo put together baskets with tampons for her classmates that included quotes from her role model, Hillary Clinton, NBC News reports.
“Women’s rights are human rights,” one of the notes read. “Human rights are women’s rights.”
The teen said she learned how to take action against the corrupt system through her school’s social justice class, which teaches all about oppression, race, gender and other social justice things.
“Hillary Clinton inspired me because she kept being strong and she didn’t take any of the insults people threw at her and didn’t let it affect her,” she said.
“It inspired me in a way that I can’t really describe,” Longo continued. “I realized even if I didn’t succeed in getting equal rights for men and women, that I had tried and all that mattered was that I tried my hardest to get equal access to education.”
Longo’s efforts convinced school officials to fix the broken tampon machines and make the sanitary napkins available to students for free.
Longo said it was a big win for social justice.
“I feel like if we all get together, all of the people who are in favor of social justice and equal access to education, I feel hopeful. I feel satisfied that I created this petition and wrote this letter and made a difference in our school,” she said.
A district spokesperson told NBC News officials are “very proud” of Longo for speaking out about the injustices of broken tampon machines, and “for putting into practice the skills she gained in the social justice class.”
“We have repaired any broken or empty machines and they (no) longer require any coins for feminine hygiene supplies,” the spokesperson said. “Ample supplies are also available in the heath room and locker rooms.”
Islander Co-Principal Mary Jo Budzius told the Times Longo’s social justice crusade is also reverberating to the high school, which will also now offer free tampons for students.

The truth has a funny way of coming out, even if it takes a while.
Former FBI Director James Comey is back in hot water after the FBI confirmed a little detail regarding Comey’s investigation of Hillary Clinton: Comey drafted a letter to exonerate Clinton months before he even interviewed her!
This means that he had already made up his mind on her “innocence” before he even questioned her about the overwhelming about of evidence showing her crimes. Now the question is, why?
The FBI released a document called, “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”
Fox News reports:
The contents of the email were largely unclear as nearly all of it was redacted. The now-public records show the email titled “Midyear Exam — UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016, to Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff and senior counselor James Rybicki.
On May 16, the documents showed a response email from Rybicki, saying “Please send me any comments on this statement so we may roll into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date. Thanks, Jim.”
The existence of the documents, reported by Newsweek, were first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also a member of the committee, after they reviewed transcripts of interviews with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence. The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating Comey in his role as FBI director and President Trump’s decision to fire him in May.
The two senators set out to contact the new FBI director, Christopher Wray. On August 30, they wrote a letter to Wray explaining their discover and added, ““[I]t appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work,” their letter continued, “The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.”
Daily Wire reports:
The existence of documents that prove that Comey drafted the letter exonerating Clinton before he even questioned her calls into question his Senate testimony in June, at which he said he was told by Attorney General Loretta Lynch not to refer to the criminal investigation into Clinton as an investigation, but as a “matter.”
Graham told Fox News in September that he will subpoena Comey if he has to in order to get him to return to Capitol Hill to answer more questions surrounding the investigation.
Graham said “We now know that he had made up his mind to exonerate her before he even interviewed her, which is a bit odd,” she continued, “I’m very suspicious of the timing. I’m very suspicious of the reason.”
House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy also spoke out about the the absurdity of the issue as well.
Gowdy said that it is “beyond dispute that he made up his mind not to charge Secretary Clinton before he interviewed her,” and that “he may well have made up his mind before he interviewed the last dozen witnesses.”
“There’s sufficient factual basis to bring him in and ask him, ‘when did you make up your mind that you were not going to charge Secretary Clinton?’” Gowdy concluded.

123,http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/what-now-hillary-clinton-wants-to-be-a-pastor,WHAT? Now Hillary Clinton Wants To Be A Pastor?,"How would you feel if you went to church next Sunday and “Pastor Hillary Clinton” got up to deliver the message? According to Clinton’s longtime pastor, Hillary says that she wants wants to start preaching. Considering the fact that she stands in direct opposition to just about everything that the Bible says, it is hard to imagine her doing this with a straight face. Bill and Hillary Clinton have been fueling anger and hatred toward conservative Christians for decades, but now she is suddenly going to turn over a new leaf? If Clinton announced that she had decided to denounce abortion then she would definitely get my attention, but at this point this just seems like another Clinton political stunt.
Earlier today when I came across an article published by the Atlantic entitled “Hillary Wants To Preach”, I was tempted to dismiss it as some of that “fake news” that we have been hearing so much about lately. But it turns out that this story is actually true…
Hillary Clinton wants to preach. That’s what she told Bill Shillady, her longtime pastor, at a recent photo shoot for his new book about the daily devotionals he sent her during the 2016 campaign. Scattered bits of reporting suggest that ministry has always been a secret dream of the two-time presidential candidate: Last fall, the former Newsweek editor Kenneth Woodward revealed that Clinton told him in 1994 that she thought “all the time” about becoming an ordained Methodist minister. She asked him not to write about it, though: “It will make me seem much too pious.” The incident perfectly captures Clinton’s long campaign to modulate—and sometimes obscure—expressions of her faith.
For Clinton, this would be yet another very unusual chapter in a very strange religious journey. She has always claimed to be a “Christian”, but it is also important to remember that in college she did her senior thesis on a radical leftist that dedicated his book to Lucifer…
In 1993, the president of Wellesley College approved a new rule that all senior theses written by a president or first lady of the United States would be kept under lock and key, a move aimed at preventing the public from learning about their new First Lady. After the Clintons left the White House, however, Hillary’s senior thesis was released to the public – a 92 page homage to radical leftist Saul Alinsky, who dedicated his book to Lucifer.
And back in 2015, Clinton delivered a speech in which she insisted that “religious beliefs” that do not conform to her progressive agenda “have to be changed”…
“All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.”
Hillary Clinton is not interested in the God of the Bible or in living the way that the Bible actually intends for us to live.
Clinton and her husband have been promoting just about every form of evil imaginable for decades, but that won’t matter to many people. If Hillary wants to preach, many on the left will be absolutely thrilled…
“Given her depth of knowledge of the Bible and her experience of caring for people and loving people, she’d make a great pastor,” Shillady told me. No, she probably won’t go to seminary, he said. No, she probably won’t pursue an official lay position in the Methodist church, like deaconess. (I reached out to Clinton’s spokespeople for comment, but didn’t hear back.) “I think it would be more of … her guest preaching at some point,” he said. “We have a long history of lay preachers in the United Methodist Church.”
Since the election, “I think her faith is stronger,” Shillady added. “I haven’t noticed anything different, except that I think she is more relaxed than I’ve ever seen her.” Maybe after all these years of hard-scrabble politics, Clinton is finally becoming a more straightforward version of herself: a woman whose fondest ambition is teaching scripture in church.
I am just glad that she isn’t in the White House. If she had won the 2016 election, things would have gone very badly for extremely outspoken conservatives like me.
As I keep saying, our nation is in the midst of a cultural war. If the left ultimately wins, they plan to do whatever they can to criminalize our way of thinking. And I am not the only one that is warning about this. For example, just consider what Newt Gingrich had to say about this recently…
“Remember: There are a lot of people on the other side, including in the elite news media, who deeply, deeply want President Trump to fail,” he warned, “who deeply want our values to be wiped out by making them, frankly, illegal, and who are deeply committed to changing America in ways that would turn it into a country you and I would have no real knowledge of and no understanding of.”
In an America where the political and cultural divisions seem to be widening, Gingrich pointed out Trump can make a real difference.
“He’s clearly committed to breaking up political correctness,” the former Georgia representative said. “He’s clearly committed to advocating the kind of future that we want for our children and our grandchildren.”
I wrote quite a bit about this cultural war in my brand new book entitled “Living A Life That Really Matters”. It is my most important book yet, and just today I had someone tell me how it had deeply affected them. The truth matters, and many on the left are trying very hard to convince us that right is wrong and that wrong is right.
If Hillary Clinton wants to “preach”, she certainly has the right to do so.
But in the end, her side is not going to win. No matter how hard the left tries to twist and distort the Bible, the plain meaning of the Scriptures is there for everyone to see. The Bible has been changing hearts and minds all over the planet for centuries, and nothing is going to change that.
And Hillary Clinton better be careful, because if she starts reading the Bible too much it might end up changing her heart too…

Ashley Judd was the land’s reigning warrior princess, stalking serial killers and bringing philandering, fraudster husbands to justice. Those were fun times, when world-class actors were thrown into outrageous melodramatic roles and directors could float implausible conspiracy premises on moody atmospheres and committed performances. (We got so many from Denzel Washington.) But if they got just one element wrong — a cartoonish villain hung out to dry by a bland supporting cast or flat cinematography — that kind of film’s whole mystique just dissipated; we could see that the emperor wore no clothes, and his dialogue was nonsensical. I’m looking at you, Harry Connick Jr., in Copycat, though I appreciate your teaching me about agoraphobia.
Dean Devlin, the director of Geostorm and the co-producer of Independence Day, seems to be attempting to usher in a renaissance of that era. His uneven new thriller, Bad Samaritan — with its title sounding very Grisham — tells the story of a low-level thief who breaks into a fancy-schmancy house and discovers a woman being held captive in a plastic-lined, camera-surveilled room. The homeowner proves to be a psychopath — who is also obsessed with horses. When the thief attempts to bring this criminal to justice, the usual game of cat and mouse ensues. Really, this premise is no more ridiculous than that of Kiss the Girls (1997), Double Jeopardy (1999), Fallen (1998), or The Bone Collector (1999), and acclaimed Scottish actor David Tennant commits to his role as seething, calculating villain Cale Erendreich. But there’s frightfully little atmosphere to this film — anything from creepy sound design to evocative cinematography — rendering the flaws in the story all too visible. (The screenwriter is Brandon Boyce, who’s also responsible for Bryan Singer’s 1998 flop of a Stephen King adaptation, Apt Pupil, which had Ian McKellen playing an aging Nazi in hiding and uttering the befuddling line, “Oh, my dear boy. Don’t you see? We are fucking each other.”)
From the outset, Devlin muddles the basics, like continuity. In the opening scene, when perky Riley (Jacqueline Byers) greets boyfriend Sean (Robert Sheehan) at his door, Riley at first is wearing a full face of makeup and a bra under her shirt, and then suddenly the lipstick is gone, and she takes off her shirt to reveal she’s got nothing on underneath. It’s difficult to get an audience to buy into a suspension of disbelief when the director doesn’t seem to care about the details. Later, Riley is roughed up to the point where I was positive she had to be dead, or at least have suffered a broken neck. The next scene finds her in a hospital bed with perfect eye makeup and a breathing tube down her throat. Despite that tube — usually there for people who are, like, in a coma? — our hero is relatively energetic, lifting herself out of bed to write “Get out” on a notepad and show it to Sean, as though she’ll just have a bruise and be fine in the morning.
While Riley’s character seems to be an afterthought in this story, Cale has been given the weirdest, most elaborate, and unnecessary backstory to justify his madness and violence. I won’t give it away, but suffice to say there is an awkward horse statue jammed into the production design of every room in Cale’s house and cabin. In some ways, Bad Samaritan is like Equus meets Don’t Breathe, but that’s giving it too much credit, considering the relative tameness of its action and dialogue. Devlin could have had Tennant go full Shakespearean malefactor, a fireball of bluster and hysteria, but Cale barely gets to say a word.
My favorite character, the abductee Katie (Kerry Condon), also gets the shaft when it comes to dialogue because for most of the movie, she’s got a horse’s bit wedged into her teeth. When she’s allowed to speak freely, however, Boyce lets loose with the film’s most cutting lines. And though Tennant ditches his Scots dialect and reveals a perfect American accent here, I found it a confusing choice that Devlin would allow the Irishman Sheehan, as Cale’s foil, to keep his accent, while both are supposedly living in Portland, Oregon.
At the very least, Bad Samaritan showcases how much rich assholes have taken over that once working-class city, as Cale and his personality-less huge house seem to fit right in; this picture has all the signs of a movie that got an Oregon tax credit and had to switch locations at the last minute and then somehow accidentally stumbled onto a Portland truth. But if you ever wanted to know what David Tennant would look like with a perm, this movie might be for you.

According to Gateway Pundit:
“Comey served as general counsel at Lockheed Martin until 2010 when he departed with over $6 million to show for it. That same year Lockheed Martin became a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and “won 17 contracts from the U.S. State Department, which was led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,” Big League Politics reports.
Comey just so happened to have joined the board of the British bank HSBC Holdings in 2013, which just so happens to be a Clinton Foundation partner.”
However, one of the most shocking (and important) conflicts of interest of note is this: Comey’s brother, Peter Comey, works for the Washington law firm DLA Piper, and serves as its “Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas.”
So, who is DLA Piper, you ask? Well, DLA Piper happens to be one of the top ten all-time career campaign donors for Hillary Clinton. On top of this, DLA Piper also happens to do the Clinton Foundation’s taxes. And if that isn’t telling enough, DLA Piper also performed the 2015 audit of the Clinton Foundation when the scandal first broke.

“So there are reports of children being worried, feeling uncertain, even unsafe. Trying to make sense of their places in the world.
“The children’s commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already raised concerns that children’s interests are getting short shrift in the Brexit process.”

Some protesters gathered outside the campus ahead of Mrs Clinton’s visit.
The university’s college of law was renamed The Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law and she was presented with a book about her Welsh roots.
The former first lady appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration, accusing political leaders of “stoking divisions” and saying that “anger and resentment” were underpinning the national conversation.
“The bonds of community that once united us are fraying. Too much of the current discourse on both sides of the Atlantic is dominated by a zero-sum view of life, which argues that if someone else is gaining, I must be losing,” she said.
“The measure of any society is how we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially our children. And when we lose empathy, when it does become everyone for themselves, children are the first to suffer.
“Just look at my own country where currents of anger and resentment are underpinning our national conversation.
“Americans are divided and less trusting of democratic institutions. But instead of bringing people together we have leaders who stoke our divisions, try to distract us with controversy, after controversy, and undermine free speech and the press.
“It is nearly impossible for children’s voices to rise above the cacophony. And it is not coincidence that when politicians in Washington were arguing over protests at sporting events and cavalierly alluding to nuclear war, one of the first things to fall through the cracks was children’s healthcare.”
Mrs Clinton’s great-grandparents were from south Wales and emigrated to the US in search of a better life. Her ethnic breakdown has been calculated by genealogists as 31.2% Welsh in origin.
In her lecture, Mrs Clinton said: “As a child growing up Wales was a part of my wider understanding because it had special place in my heart due to my family’s connections to it.”
Mrs Clinton said she planned on returning to Swansea in the future: “I feel a special connection to the work of this school because your central focus on children’s human rights is my life’s mission.”",hillary,NONE,"probably favor, but not evident from text"

Are feminists morally required to be vegetarian or vegan?
This dilemma brings out some strong opinions, and here’s Celia Edell to share what it means to her – as a feminist vegetarian who doesn’t apply her choice to others.
She breaks down the main arguments for feminist vegetarianism, then explores the dilemma – if supporting the meat industry is destructive to equality in some ways, does that mean you have to give up meat to be a “good” feminist?
This issue is more complicated than it’s often presented, and Celia has some important points about how everyone is in a different position when it comes to including vegetarianism or veganism in their feminism. Does any of this information relate to your relationship with meat?

304,http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/10/feminism-and-yoga/,What’s So Feminist About Yoga? Here Are 4 Amazing Connections,"Yoga is not feminist.
Or that’s what you might think if you only know yoga through the lens of our capitalist, body-shaming, fitness-obsessed American culture.
Seeing magazine covers of thin, wealthy, White, cis women talking about “how to get yoga abs” certainly isn’t appealing for those of us working to eradicate inequality and oppression – nor does it make us want to give the practice a try.
The historical and contemporary colonization process of Western yoga serves to whitewash and erase yoga’s South Asian roots, while privileging the voices and bodies of White (heterosexual, cisgender, and wealthy) Americans as the owners, purveyors, and consumers of yoga.
This is certainly not feminist. Heterosexism, cultural appropriation, racism, inaccessibility, profit-driving, gender policing, and body shaming are not feminist values; in fact, recognizing and fighting against them are a necessary part of an intersectional feminist movement. And yet, these are all very present elements of yoga in America today.
They’re also completely counter to the values of the practice.
Feminism and yoga are in no way contradictory. In fact, despite all of this, I would argue that yoga and feminism are authentically bound. Despite the destruction that Western patriarchal capitalism has had on yoga practice and culture, yoga holds subversive, feminist elements that can strengthen our movement.
So what role can yoga play in the feminist movement? How does yoga challenge capitalism and systemic oppression, or strengthen our ability to be agents of social change?
What is so feminist about yoga?
Here are four things to consider.
1. Yoga Changes Our Relationships to Our Bodies
“By being physical without a focus on weight-loss or competition, yoga can help you become a witness to negative self-talk that comes from years of misguided influence of the media and other cultural forces. Despite what Instagram might look like, yoga can help you reject attachment to cultural beauty standards so that you can feel comfortable in your own skin.” —Veronica Rottman, feminist yoga instructor and doula
Although yoga has only in the last several decades begun to occupy a visible place in the American mainstream, yoga has been practiced globally for over 5,000 years. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit root “yuj” meaning “to yoke,” or “to come together,” “to unite.”
The union of the mind and body is at the core of yoga and is certainly no small goal. We tend to view the mind and body as separate things in our culture, and we promote division by prioritizing one over the other.
Certainly, living under an endless amount of body-shaming, victim-blaming, and social pressures around sex and body image creates a context for toxic relationships with our bodies.
Feminism takes up this cause by examining, deconstructing, and challenging these norms. Yoga takes up the cause through the practice of embodiment. This process means connecting and reconnecting and coming into our bodies just by noticing what we’re feeling without judgment or any attempt to control or change those physical and emotional experiences.
Our bodies hold our life stories. They hold our grief and trauma, our anxiety, our sadness, our joy, our histories. And while we live in an incredibly cognitive world, we can’t always verbally explain what’s happened and is happening in our bodies. In fact, most of the time, we don’t even notice or care. The division of our “self” from our bodies allows the space for constant negative self-talk, criticism, and punishment of our bodies for just being what they are.
In a world that teaches us to constantly try to “take control” over ourselves – our bodies, our weight, our health, our emotions – it can be a radically feminist experience to learn to simply hold the space for our bodies to feel whatever sensations arise, to allow ourselves to carry what our bodies want to hold onto, to let go of what they no longer need, to breathe in their history and each passing moment.
This is what yoga teaches – to be in our bodies, fully, and to love the movement and sensations and emotions, with all their complexity.
2. Yoga Can Help Us Heal From Trauma
“Feminism offered the ideological tools to examine my tortured relationship with my body systematically and deconstruct mediated images. Yoga provided the practice that rooted the things feminism had taught me. It is one thing to intellectualize self-love and acceptance, it’s another to embody it.” —Melanie Klein, academic, feminist, yoga instructor
To live in this world as a person of marginalized identities is to experience trauma.
As I’ve discussed in past posts, oppression is immensely bad for your mental health. Healing from the systemic and interpersonal violence that one endures in this world, then, must hold a central role in our movement.
We cannot build a movement of strength without acknowledging the daily trauma (big T and little t) that has been carried out in the name of white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, and other systems of oppression.
When it comes to healing from trauma, both yoga and feminism play important and overlapping roles. While feminism gives us the framework for letting go of internalized shame, yoga grounds that healing in our bodies.
Increasing research shows that because we hold trauma in our bodies, yoga often gives us the tools we need to release it, to let go of the weight and conditioning and to find a new strength for moving through the world.
This process of healing and building strength and power is such a central part of our work. To be a part of this movement is to acknowledge the trauma inherent in living under and alongside rape culture, police violence in Black communities, violence against abortion providers, the prison industrial complex, gender and sexuality-based hate crimes, and the list goes on and on.
We are witnesses to this trauma, and we are survivors of it. The practice of being present to it, to being awake, and to healing are central to yoga, and central to our social justice work.
The practice of yoga is not only healing – its philosophy also speaks to our social justice goals: The ultimate goal of yoga is liberation.
Yogic philosophy also holds values such as ahimsa, or nonviolence, and kharma, or selfless action, at its core. Yoga, like feminism, seeks to dismantle and deconstruct cultural notions and belief systems through critical thinking, or kind questioning.
It values non-duality and fluidity of the self and in our expression of gender. The idea of “wiping the fog from the mirror” is a common one in yoga – that we can wipe away that which clouds our clarity, that we can be increasingly conscious and awake to what is happening around us.",feminism,FAVOR,
260,https://www.dcstatesman.com/ny-times-says-revolution-killed-millions-great-feminism/,The NY Times Says Revolution That Killed Millions Was ‘Great’ For Feminism,"In a recent New York Times opinion piece, one journalist said that a movement that was responsible for killing nearly 45 million people in four years said it was well worth it because it progressed feminism in the end.
Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer for the NYT and she wrote about her grandmother who was a journalist during China’s communist revolution.
Gao wrote of her grandmother “talking with joyous peasants” and about how she helped turn “an anonymous candy salesman into a national labor hero.”
While speaking to her grandmother further it sounds more like she may have been a state propagandist than a reporter.
Gao’s grandmother told her of Mao’s rise to fame with China’s countryside and how a very common summary of the revolution was how horrible it was for most, but sure did help women in China.
“’The Communists did many terrible things,’ my grandmother always says at the end of her reminiscences. ‘But they made women’s lives much better,’ reports Gao.”
According to Gao, school children in China are taught that “the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories, liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy and imperialist threat.”
Gao goes on to say that it is a testament to the Communists Party’s campaign strategy that through their propaganda techniques they were able to show that women were being empowered by displaying them as equal to men in the workforce, while also paying them less and women not even noticing.
The propaganda her grandmother probably helped with made women be able to describe their experiences in exclusively official campaign rhetoric.
“And by inundating society with rhetoric blithely celebrating its achievements, the revolution deprived women of the private language with which they might understand and articulate their personal experiences,’ said Gao.”
This led to the women of China being brainwashed into believing their life was better than it actually was.
“For women in the workplace to adhere to this narrowly defined acceptable female image meant to see, understand and speak about their life not as it was, but as what it ought to be according to the party ideal.”
To this day, older women in China who went through the revolution still uphold Mao’s famous pronouncement on gender equality which was “Women hold up half the sky.” Gao says that her grandmother still talks about this slogan while also mentioning Mao’s downfalls in the same sentence.
Gao also manages to gloss over most of the genocide and human rights abuses that also apparently marked the liberation of women in China too.
While Gao mentions all of the terrible and contradictory things women had to face in Mao’s China, she decides for some reason to end her piece by stating that “For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big.”
Gao discounts her whole point of women in China being brainwashed by her last paragraph when she essentially says at least some women were allowed to work in factories (more like labor camps) instead of the farms.
What a gain for women!
For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big https://t.co/Fci82iAPxM

For more information on why it is important to avoid bi+ erasure, please check out these articles: 1 2 3)
I came out and of age in the feminist movement, which means that I have done a lot of work alongside straight women – a lot of which has centered around bringing people into the movement, educating folks about what feminism is, dispelling myths about what it isn’t, and doing modern-day consciousness raising to get more people involved on a global level.
And it’s in those feminist recruitment spaces that I find that many well-intentioned, totally awesome, usually straight colleagues pull out an old and tired line we’re all familiar with: “We’re not all lesbians!”
Unfortunately, many of the myths about feminism that scare people away are more concerned with who feminists are than what we do or believe in.
People are worried we’re all bra-burning, man-hating, witchcraft-practicing lesbians who refuse to shave and don’t give a damn about looking good.
To which I say: So what if we are?
If all feminists were queer women with unshaved legs who embraced their bodies regardless of what they looked like and gathered in the woods to cast spells, I wouldn’t give a damn. Because none of that matters!
Some feminists are thin and some are fat. Some are queer and some are straight. Some shave and some don’t.
None of that changes what feminism is truly about: building space, and ultimately, an entire planet, in which all women are safe – no matter who they are.
And that’s why when we tell people we’re not all fat and we’re not all ugly and we’re not all lesbians – even though we know that having people of different sizes, appearances, and sexualities in the movement doesn’t matter, and actually makes it stronger – we’re doing it a huge disservice.
Feminism is a movement that’s based in breaking norms.
It’s often perceived as being, first and foremost, about breaking gender norms. Feminism rejects the idea that women should only be housewives and caretakers. Feminism rejects a gender binary that pits women against men, and then renders them subordinate. And feminism rejects the idea that there is any part of our genders or sexualities that should be dictated by other people’s expectations.
But feminism is also about breaking other norms, and often challenging the oppressive roots of our own cultures directly.
Feminism is a movement that declares that economic justice is tied to liberation. It’s a movement that challenges itself to be more inclusive of women of color, queer women, trans women, and agender and gender non-conforming people.
It’s a globally minded movement that amplifies the voices of people around the world who are advocating for themselves against patriarchy.
No, we’re not all lesbians. But some of us are. That’s one of the things that makes up the fabric of the modern-day feminist movement and shapes its direction. And that’s why proudly telling people “we’re not all lesbians” isn’t okay.
When we apologize for the things that make feminism radical or the aspects of our community and movement that smash normative ideas, we misrepresent what we’re all about.
These three things are what you’re really saying when you tell people feminists “aren’t all lesbians.” And they’re three reasons you shouldn’t say it anymore.
1. It Defines Feminism by Oppressive Standards of Normality
When we talk about the norm, we’re talking about a series of hurtful and oppressive social structures that maintain imbalances of power.
The norm is patriarchy, white supremacy, classism, heterosexism, cissexism, and a slew of other systems of privilege all wrapped up into one tiny phrase.
We’re brought up in a culture that tries to push that norm onto us – and one of the main goals of feminism is smashing that norm and replacing it with societal ideas that are more fair, equal, and balanced.
It’s societal norms that tell us women should be homemakers and mothers, and nothing more. It’s societal norms that tell us women should do all they can to please and attract men, and then define themselves in relation to those men.
It’s societal norms that tell us cis, thin, white women are the ideal – and that women of color and trans women are lesser than them. It’s societal norms that shame poor women. It’s societal norms that shame single moms.
And it’s societal norms that define queer women – and lesbians in particular – as unattractive, broken people who failed to fit into that rigid set of expectations.
As feminists, we should know better than to believe in those norms.
We should recognize and remember that queer women have been major players in the feminist movement. We should hold in reverence that they have redefined and challenged dominant feminist discourse, and broadened the scope of what women’s empowerment looked like in the process.
We should know that queer women, like other women who live at the intersections of oppression, are an asset to the feminist movement – and an important part of its life and trajectory.
And we shouldn’t apologize for it.
But that’s what we’re doing when we tell people we’re not all lesbians. When we say that, we’re caving to those norms.
We’re trying to make feminism more palatable and attractive, and we’re doing so by selling out some of our sisters.
In saying it, we are, in effect, incorrectly defining our own movement. Because even though we aren’t all lesbians, we are a movement that also understands and must stand for the idea that there’s nothing wrong with the fact that some of us are.
When we apologize for queer feminists, we’re communicating that we, in some way, stand for all those societal norms that hurt all women, and all people.
And that just ain’t right.
2. Because It Isolates (And Shames) Queer Feminists
Take it from me: When you’re queer and you hear someone apologizing for your identity, it doesn’t feel good.
This year, Bisexual Awareness Day/Celebrate Bisexuality Day was on September 23rd.
That same day, the National LGBTQ Task Force thought it’d be a good idea to post an article entitled “Bye Bye Bi, Hello Queer,” in which leadership programs director Evangeline Weiss said “she is ready ‘to say bye bye to the word bisexuality.’
She said it does not describe her sexual orientation, and she encouraged readers to cease using the word as well as she felt it reinforced a binary concept of gender.
Let me drive that home a little more. The National LGBTQ Task Force not only thought it would be a good idea to publish an article insulting, misrepresenting, and forsaking the bisexual letter in their own name, but did so on Celebrate Bisexuality Day.
Rude.
And a fantastic example of the constant, ongoing erasure bisexual people have to deal with. This one just happened to be incredibly blatant.
What happened as a result of that article? People got pissed.
People got so pissed that the Task Force not only removed the article from their website, but posted in its place this non-apology (it keeps being referred to as an apology, but I’m not so easily pleased): “Having listened to a wide array of feedback on the timing and content, we recognize that this blog offended people. For this we sincerely apologize. It has been removed.”
In other words, “Sorry you got pissed off. Hopefully you’ll shut up if we take it down.” Which, as far as I can tell, isn’t much of an apology for a blatant disregard of an entire community of people.
Misunderstanding of the bisexual community has been the crux of biphobia’s history and the ongoing battle to erase bisexuality from the LGBTQIA+ community.
It’s a scary time to be bi, especially when your lesbian, gay, pansexual, and queer siblings and allies are calling for your blood simply because they’ve fallen victim to the mainstream agenda without realizing it. (Say what?! Jump to #5.)
It’s time for a change.
It’s time for all of us to properly understand one another and to — hope of hopes — become allies for our incredibly similar endeavors. To help initiate that friendship, I ask you, dear reader, to go through the following three steps.
Step 1: Look below. If I’ve played my cards right, virtually every reader should find at least one category with which they identify.
Step 2: Approach your designated section(s) with an open mind, an unprejudiced heart, and a desire to further enhance your own community/ies. It’s difficult for people to learn new things and see different views if they automatically approach them with resistance, which is often the case with bisexual topics.
Step 3: See how bi erasure hurts you as a person and, while you’re at it, likely hurts the people you care about. Because it really is happening.
So here are five ways in which bi erasure is hurting people of layered identities.
1. Female-Identified People and Feminists
Bisexuality is one of the only non-monosexual* identities currently recognized in the English-speaking world. If bisexuality is kept underground, it suppresses our limited, precious resources for open discussion about non-monosexuality. This hurts female-identified people and feminists regardless of their sexual orientation.
To this day, female-identified people can’t get a fair shake. Pay is unequal, birth control access is limited, and objectification is a daily thing. Non-monosexual women in particular are often not taken seriously because they’re seen as sluts, greedy, or unable to make up their minds.
Also, the general fetishizing of women is particularly intensified in the bisexual realm by (straight-identified) men, turning the very act of women’s sexual freedom, empowerment, and self-expression into nothing more than something for male gazes. (This is most often seen through the relentless prompts for female-female-male threesomes and masculine catcalls in bars when two femme-appearing women make out.)
By participating in or casually allowing bi erasure to happen, we’re ignoring the specific plights and abuses of bisexual women, thereby contributing to the ongoing problem of female inequality, objectification, and silence.
As feminists, we can’t pick and choose which women to fight for. The complexities of womanhood — and all of its cultural suppressions — are an all-or-none deal.
*Note: Non-monosexuality usually refers to someone who is interested in more than one sex or gender. (In other words, somebody who isn’t gay, lesbian, or straight.) Another way to say “non-monosexuality” would be “polysexuality” to help keep it from sounding negative.
2. Male-Identified People and Male Liberationists*
Just like with female-identified people and feminists, bi erasure hurts male-identified people and male liberationists regardless of their sexual orientation.
Allow me to make this pretty basic: Men continue to be fed the message that being gay is bad. Being gay means you’re not really a man, which means you lose your dude membership and the bulk of your male privilege. And since gayness equals the slightest shred of attraction to or intimacy with another male, all manners of bromance must be squashed.
In short, many guys live in a state of silent terror in this regard.
Bi men are afraid of being banished from the world of lady-loving, gay men are worried about losing all of their connections to hetero land, and nothing is worse for a straight man than being called a fag.
Constant monitoring, constant filtering, constant stress: Is this really the kind of world we guys want to keep living in?
By being able to talk about bisexuality — remember: one of our only non-monosexual identities — male-identified people can begin to break free from the masculine ideal.
Bi talk helps bridge the gap between being a man (straight) and not being a man (gay) and realizing, hey, having some manner of attraction to or intimate interaction with another guy is totally okay, masculinity unscathed.
Gay men can begin to regain their identities as men, bi men can finally start coming out, and “fag” will lose its strength as an insult from one straight man to another.
*Note: Male liberationists are more or less seen as allies to feminists and vice versa. Both will argue that patriarchy is bad, but while feminists talk of how it’s bad for females, male liberationists talk of how it’s bad for males. Examples include the inability to romantically or sexually love another male, the emasculation of men of color, and the physical, verbal, and mental abuse that comes from society’s expectations to be stereotypically masculine.

266,http://dictionary.com/e/s/feminist-whats-superpower,"I Am A Feminist, What’s Your Superpower?","Intersectionality
The term intersectionality was coined in the 1980s by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, an American civil-rights advocate and a professor of law at Columbia Law School, where she also is director and founder of the Law School’s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies.
Intersectional feminism is ""the understanding of how women’s overlapping identities —including race, class, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation— impact the way they experience oppression and discrimination."" Crenshaw explains that, “the way we imagine discrimination or disempowerment often is more complicated for people who are subjected to multiple forms of exclusion. The good news is that intersectionality provides us a way to see it.”
And, of course, a way for us to discuss how we can promote inclusion.
The term heteronormative runs counter to modern feminism. It’s the belief that we are either male or female, and heterosexuality is the only normal and natural expression of sexuality. Feminists use the term when discussing—and protesting against—pigeonholing into defined and “natural” roles.
The term was popularized in the early 90s by queer-theory expert Michael Warner in his book Fear of a Queer Planet. It’s a portmanteau of hetero, meaning ""opposite,"" and normativity, meaning ""a system of normative assumptions.""
The insult factor that comes with the slew of man- words created from the feminist movement shouldn't distract from the true mission of equal rights. These man- words are also calls for attention to the ways men have and can demean women.
Mansplaining, a portmanteau of man and explaining, describes the condescending or sexist way men explain things to women. In 2008, Rebecca Solnit wrote an essay in the Los Angeles Times in which she described this situation without naming it. But, other women recognized it and began using this term and others.
Manterrupting is the unnecessary interruption of a woman by a man–and taking credit for a woman’s idea.
And, manspreading is when men sit on buses and subways with their legs spread wide apart to accommodate their . . . man parts.
Whether you agree with the usage of these terms or not, they have become pretty mainstream (yes, some are even in the dictionary!). See the next term to understand how man-bashing can cross a line though.
Misandry is ""the hatred, dislike, or distrust of men."" It comes from the Greek misos meaning ""hatred"" and andros meaning ""of or belonging to a man."" The term is akin to the original sense of misogyny, which is ""the hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women.""
Why is misandry considered a modern feminist term? Because women need to be careful that male-bashing doesn’t go too far. It’s one thing to call out men when they behave badly, but sweeping condemnations and generalizations should not be lobbied against all men. Oftentimes misandry backfires and creates hostility toward women, as well.
The term transmisogyny was coined in 2007 by Julia Serano in her book Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity. It means ""the discrimination or prejudice against transgender women.""
The word is an intersection of two types of oppression that transgender women are subjected to: transphobia and misogyny. Feminists use this term to call specific attention to discrimination against trans women, which often results in sexual assault or domestic violence.
Cisgender, or just cis, is a term for a person whose gender identity corresponds with their biological sex assigned at birth. It’s the opposite of transgender. German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the term in his 1998 essay “The Neosexual Revolution.”
Feminists object to this term because they see it as validating the notion that there are only two genders correlating with two sexes, just male and female. It doesn't embrace the LGBTQ community (a community feminists fight for and support!).
Privilege refers to a set of advantages enjoyed by a majority group. Historically, feminism catered to white, straight, cisgender women. But, today's feminists often remind us to “check your privilege.”
In other words, women of privilege must think about sexual inequality beyond their own experiences and understand how it affects women of color and LGBT women, as well. Feminism isn't exclusive.
The term male gaze was coined in 1975 by feminist film critic Laura Mulvey in her essay “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” It means depicting the world and women in visual arts and literature from a heterosexual point of view, in which women are seen as objects for male pleasure.
Feminists view male gaze in three ways: how men look at women, how women look at themselves, and how women look at other women. Male gaze reinforces stereotypes and causes unnecessary competition and criticism. But, there’s hope of breaking through these stereotypes as women directors and writers make inroads in Hollywood.
The 2009 book Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape, by Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti, inspired the “No Means No” campaign against date rape, particularly on college campuses.
In 2015, California became the first state to require that all high-school health education classes give lessons on affirmative consent, which includes explaining that someone who is drunk or asleep cannot grant consent. In 2015, New York passed a similar bill called “Enough Is Enough.”
Still, Harvard law professor Janet Halley and other feminists caution against treating sex exclusively as a danger from which women should seek the authorities’ protection. And, male students argue that “victim-centered” policies are biased. This is a debate (and a cause) that will be continued . . . .

Feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It encompasses social, political, and economic equality. A belief is one thing, putting it into practice is another.
Women have fought for equal rights, and, clearly, have made some progress. But, inequality between men and women still exists, and that has given rise to radical feminism, an outgrowth of the 1960s women’s liberation movement. Radical feminists believe inequality stems from patriarchy and that male supremacy must be abolished in economic, legal, social, and political arenas.

To translate the all-day event into reality took a great deal of thought and work but when I showed up, it quickly became clear they’d thought of everything. Located in the redeveloped Regent Park neighborhood in Toronto’s east end, Daniels Spectrum’s is in a bit of a food desert, with not a lot of choices nearby, so various food vendors were brought in for the day. The building itself was chosen for its accessibility, and inside there were non-gendered bathrooms, a team of volunteers trained with naloxone kits, a “community card engagement” station where people could write down their info if they want to make fest friends, and so on. The whole thing seemed exhaustive, going above and beyond the usual of organization other large festivals undertake.
When I complimented her on how all-encompassing the festival was, Fogel laughed and said that was the goal. The entire experience ran smoothly from a spectator’s perspective, which is remarkable since it’s the first festival Fogel has ever thrown, but it also had to. As a living critique of the way most festivals have a structured gender imbalance in their lineups, there was a tremendous amount of pressure for Venus Fest’s argument to be airtight.
If something went wrong, if there weren’t enough attendees, if the sound wasn’t good or the lineup lagging, all of those issues become fodder for the majority of concert promoters who are disinterested in correcting the way that concert and festival lineups regularly skew male. Instead, throughout the day Venus Fest shone as a beacon of what could be.",feminism,FAVOR,

But this is not an opinion that will endear you to many feminists, even other women. “How can you alienate your own allies?” they say. “How perfect do you really expect them to be?” they say. “Why are you so distrustful? How jaded can you be?”
But especially in dating as a feminist woman who seeks romantic and sexual relationships with men, it’s a necessity. It’s a question that needs to be asked. It’s a suspicion well-advised.
Male feminists are not immune to their masculine socialization – which is categorically toxic. They’re supposed to seek to dismantle it. But with so many stories floating around (and the many more that are silenced by fear) about “male feminists” who use their social justice rhetoric as a way to wield abusive behaviors, it’s clear that some of our quote-unquote “allies” are combining toxic masculinity with feminism to create a terrifying hybrid.
So, take it from us: Beware male feminists.
Because sometimes, under the cloak of feminism can lie a fearful reality.
1. Beware Male Feminists Who Seek to Control Your Sexuality
Beware men who learn words like liberation and body positive and sexual agency – and use them to guilt you into sex.
Beware men whose “I believe in women’s lib” really translates to “I believe women should have sexual agency, insofar as it benefits me.”
Beware men who support your right to have sex, but not your right not to have sex.
Beware men who don’t let you refuse, who demand of you more than “just vanilla,” who expect you (out of liberation) to take control.
Beware men who say “no means no,” but act like a lack of a no is the same thing as a yes – and then defend themselves with “You know I do anti-rape work” when they’re questioned about their own sexually violating behavior.
Beware men who say “no means no,” but tell you that women who “let down the cause” by taking control of their own bodies and sexual agency deserve what they get.
Beware men who say that they’re anti-rape, but think Beyoncé “shouldn’t dress like that” now that she’s a mother.
Beware men who watch porn, but degrade sex workers.
Beware men who distance themselves from men who perpetrate sexual and physical violence by insisting that “real men” don’t do those things.
Beware men who don’t make space for you to voice your desires and boundaries in bed – who are performing equality so strongly that they don’t practice justice; who expect you to speak up, but who never ask.
Your a/sexuality belongs to you.
2. Beware Male Feminists Who Believe They Have a Right to Your Appearance
Beware men who don’t like your red lipstick because it’s “not feminist,” but claim that sex with them will liberate you from patriarchy.
Beware men who question your use of mascara on your eyelashes or a razor on your legs, who tell you, “You don’t have to do that for me,” but ignore you when you say you aren’t.
Beware men who tell you that you look better without the makeup, the high heels, the short skirts you love – as though you do those things for them.
Beware men who drop hints about your “natural beauty” – ostensibly to free you from the binds of patriarchal oppression – and then suggest nude shades over bright ones.
Beware men who are “body positive” when thin people wear bikinis, but not when fat people do.
Beware men who tokenize their past partners to prove a point about being an “equal-opportunity, affirmative action” dater.
Beware men who believe their dating only white girls is a “preference,” but your not being attracted to them means you’re being unfair.
Beware men who ask, “Who are you getting all done up for?” – as if looking good for your own sake isn’t good enough.
Only you get to decide what you put on your body.
3. Beware Male Feminists Who Hide Their Abusive Tactics Behind a Gender-Equality Mask
Beware men who use the language of social justice to manipulate you.
Beware men who learn words like gaslighting so that they can accuse you of it when you disagree with them.
Beware men who wield their intersections of oppression as proof that they cannot be abusive toward you – because you hold more social power than they do.
Beware men who proclaim to support anti-violence work, but are violent in their own interactions.
Beware men who tell you “abuser dynamics” are when you lose your temper and can’t tell them why because you’re too hurt to think.
Beware men who financially exploit you, but then throw in your face that you make more money than they do.
Beware men who use words like bitch, slut, and cunt when angry in reference to you or other women.
Beware men who are aware that they have higher standing than you do in your feminist communities and (implicitly or explicitly) use that to control you.
Beware men who ask “Are you saying that I’m a bad feminist?” – as if that possibility is worse than the fact that they hurt you; as if that’s not a derailing tactic.
Beware men who learned about [insert feminist here] in Women’s Studies – and quote her during arguments to derail and silence you.
Beware men who pressure you to adopt behaviors and ideologies that suit them, under the guise that you need to radicalize.
If they’re wielding power and control over you, it’s abuse – no matter how prettily they disguise that.
4. Beware Male Feminists Who Set Up Womanhood As a Competition
Beware men who tell you you’re so much more clever, more mature than other girls, that they’ve never met a girl as enlightened as you.
Beware men who say they only sleep with smart girls, or liberal girls, or radical girls, as though those things are performances for them.
Beware men who treat you like a manic pixie dream girl who will whisk them away into a feminist wonderland.
Beware men who position themselves as arbiters of which women are “feminist enough” – and consider those who don’t meet the bar acceptable targets.
Beware men who divide you into the “good” ones and the “bad” ones – and play you against each other.
Beware men who divide you into “girls,” “women,” and “females,” depending on how they view the acceptability of your behavior.
Beware men who question the authenticity of other women’s feminism.
Beware men whose love and respect is contingent on your adherence to their idea of feminism, femaleness, femininity.
Womanhood is not a competition.
5. Beware Male Feminists Who Wield Masculine Objectivity As a Tool in Arguments
Beware men who value objectivity over subjectivity, especially the ones who consider themselves the final arbiters of what objectivity is.
Beware men who say they support women, but make you feel less intelligent for not being as “rational” as they are during arguments about your own rights.
Beware men who “play devil’s advocate” in conversations about your own lived experiences.
Beware men who think rational people should always separate the art from the artist, even when that artist is a violent predator.
Beware men who shoulder their way into feminist spaces so they can inject them with male “logic,” “reason,” and “rationality.”
Beware men who don’t own their biases.
Beware men whose first words when you relate your lived experience are “well, actually” or “not all.”
Beware men who ever call you “irrational” or “emotional” to silence you.",feminism,FAVOR,
287,https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/09/no-body-positivity-no-feminism/,3 Reasons Why You Can’t Have Body Positivity Without Feminism,"This article was originally published in Beauty School and republished here with the author’s permission
I was a guest on a body-positive podcast when the lightbulb went off: Not everyone in this work identifies as feminist.
There I was, sitting on my couch, my iPhone earbuds in, staring at the empty Skype screen in front of me, while the host asked me the most basic questions about what liberation from patriarchy looks like in practice. I can’t raise one eyebrow — hell, I can’t even wink — but if I had possessed the skill, an eyebrow would have been raised in suspicion.
Maybe I had been naive before. Or maybe because my forays into both social justice and body acceptance had happened simultaneously, there was obvious overlap for me. But it hadn’t occurred to me that it was possible to talk about body oppression without an explicitly intersectional feminist lens.
The truth is: You can’t.
You can’t have body positivity without feminism.
But the longer I’m involved with this work, the more I notice how frequently people (and, unsurprisingly, usually the most privileged folks) support the former without the latter — and how fucking harmful that is.
And yet, I (and others, especially more marginalized people) receive a lot of pushback from quote-unquote #BOPO babes when I engage with them on this. Whether they explicitly believe that feminism and body acceptance are unrelated or more implicitly just don’t infuse their body positivity with justice-oriented values, these folks feel offended, attacked, bullied, or called out when they’re approached about this misalignment.
So I want to be clear: If you’re doing body-positive work, you’re borrowing directly from feminism. And if you’re not owning that and practicing its inherent values, your body positivity is useless.
Here are three reasons why.
1. Viewing Bodies Socioculturally Is Rooted in Feminist Theory
I’m honestly confused about folks who can talk all day about tools of patriarchy – like narrow beauty standards and advertising media – without ever actually using the word patriarchy.
There’s a clear understanding within the #BOPO realm that women are culturally conditioned to hate our bodies and that our approximation to beauty is what defines our social value. The conversation about how we’re not born with self-hatred, but taught it through propaganda, is there.
But where do you think those ideas came from?
The concept that our bodies are imbued with socially constructed meaning – and that we need to unpack that to get at the core of the problem – isn’t new. It’s been the foundation of various feminist theory for, like, ever.
The idea of body acceptance is rooted in a structural evaluation of the world. And every watered down thing you say about women and bodies comes from a much more complex history of feminist analysis.
Need a place to start? Try Susan Bordo’s Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.
2. Body-Based Oppression Exists On Intersecting Axes
Listen: Body-based oppression is a social justice issue. More to the point: It’s anintersectional issue. It’s not something that only affects women (or “men, too!”); it’s not even something that only affects people on the axis of a/gender. Body-based oppression is an inherent part of all marginalization.
Racial profiling is body-based oppression. Discrimination for disability is body-based oppression. Lack of access to healthcare, nutritious food, and shelter is body-based oppression. The fetishization of queer women is body-based oppression. The murder of trans women is body-based oppression. Fat stigma is body-based oppression.
Intersectionality — a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, and a concept discussed previously by many Black feminists, including Audre Lorde and Patricia Hill Collins — is the idea that we are all constellations, not single stars. I am not only a woman or only queer or only white or only cisgender. I am all of those things at once. And all of those identities together affect my experience within my body and society’s experience of it.
We can’t leave this shit out.
Body positivity has to be feminist because it has to be intersectional.
And if you’re ready to learn more about that (please! please be ready!), start perusing The Body Is Not an Apology.
3. Fat Acceptance Is Being Diluted
Let’s be clear: Body positivity was stolen from fat acceptance. No, this isn’t up for debate.
The fat acceptance movement – which arguably unofficially began in 1967 when 500 New Yorkers took to Central Park to protest anti-fat bias but had stirrings leading up to that point – is a sociopolitical movement to end suffering under and seek liberation from the institution of power known as the thin ideal.
This means pushing for fairer representation of fat people in media. It means demanding that the fashion industry take fat bodies into consideration. It means pressuring the medical industrial complex to stop exploiting the “obesity crisis.” It means asking for research studies with less inherent bias.
It means commanding the recognition of fat people’s full humanity by the public at large.
It’s radical AF.
Body positivity, on the other hand – and particularly the way it shows up in mainstream culture – is a movement for folks to make peace with their bodies, without a specific target audience. It’s much broader – and way less revolutionary.
It’s also a thief. It takes the radical, complex aims of deconstructing the thin ideal for fat acceptance and dilutes it into a more general goal of women’s empowerment. And then it profits off of the work that more marginalized people did.
Keep your eye out for the upcoming documentary Fattitude to learn more.
Feminism was at the heart of this thing. And we need to put it back.
Body acceptance is a beautiful – and wildly important – thing. I need it. You need it. Your mom’s brother’s neighbor’s kid’s best friend’s teacher needs it. But it’s only ever going to do us any good if we keep it feminist, intersectional, and radical.
Because the apolitical, watered down, scared-of-the-F-word body positivity that’s so popular right now might make (some of) us feel affirmed, but it’s not a revolt.
And we need a revolt.

283,http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/white-feminists-feminine-energy/,4 Problems with the Way White Feminists Talk About ‘Feminine Energy’,"“Hey!” I greeted a date with a smile as I got into his car. While he was on the way, I’d expressed frustration with him being as late for our fifth date as he’d been for our third and fourth. But, after an apology, I was ready to let it go and have a good time.
“Huh, interesting,” he said with a pensive expression.
“What?”
“Well, I once read somewhere that masculine energy is like a river leading into the ocean. It knows where it’s going and it flows there in the most efficient manner possible. Feminine energy, on the other hand, is the ocean, with wild, beautiful, tumultuous waves.”
In other words, by changing my mood so quickly, I was being “feminine.”
“I just felt like we were done arguing and wanted to have a good night.”
“Okay, maybe I’m overanalyzing it.”
He was, but he didn’t make this up. I’d heard this idea of “feminine energy” before, sometimes from feminists. I’d even found some liberation from internalized misogyny through it.
Growing up, I was taught to perform behaviors that our Western, capitalist culture perceives as “masculine” (and therefore valuable), such as to achieve and value work above all else, repress my emotions, and assess my self-worth based on money.
Others may have different definitions of masculinity, but the people in my life associated these traits with men and superiority.
Hearing about “feminine energy” from some feminist friends and New Age books gave me a way to identify why it felt like my fixation on logistics and rules and structure existed at the detriment of my passion and creativity.
I learned that the former traits were “masculine” ones imposed on us by Western society, the latter were “feminine,” and the way we associate these traits with gender shapes how we view them.
Since I’ve learned how masculine qualities and behaviors get prized over “feminine” ones and why that’s harmful, I’ve gotten more in touch with my wild, intuitive, nonsensical, disorderly side that wants to do things like spend a day with no plans and cry just because it feels good.
But after seeing how these ideas can lead people like my ex to pigeonhole people, I started to question them. After all, I’m a woman who struggles with being too “masculine,” so hearing that I’m innately “feminine” was super alienating to me.
And who was I, as a white person, to claim to understand concepts borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism based on a few books largely written by other white outsiders’ version of feminine energy?
Feminine energy, I realized, sounded suspiciously like the Western stereotype of women and masculine energy sounded like the stereotype of men. And that makes it dangerous to propose that there’s some spiritual, culturally transcendent principle behind both.
I understand the appeal of affirming the set of qualities commonly labeled feminine. After all, these are the traits patriarchy has deemed inferior, leading people to misinterpret strengths as weaknesses just because they’re associated with women.
I also see the appeal of making these affirmations spiritual.
The symbolism associated with gendered bodies and roles can be powerful, and some of us really experience gender as an “energy” – something too intangible to be defined more concretely.
But as a woman, a non-binary person, and a feminist, the concept of feminine energy has ultimately harmed me. It’s caused people to misinterpret my behavior because they’ve projected their idea of gender onto me. It’s led people to make assumptions about me based on my physical appearance.
It’s also part of a larger pattern of white people appropriating concepts from Asian and Native American cultures. The concept of masculine and feminine energies – and the whole “New Age” movement they’re part of – often represents a warped version of ideas borrowed from Hinduism, Buddhism, or Native spirituality.
Here are some reasons why white people, particularly white feminists, need to stop talking about “feminine energy.”
1. It Associates Certain Personality Traits with Certain Bodies
Discussions of feminine energy often use metaphors involving wombs, breasts, or vaginas to illustrate that the feminine is capable of nurturing life.
Consequently, even when people who believe in “feminine energy” admit that not all women are feminine, they usually say that most are because the “female body” lends itself to nurturing, softness, gestation, and other things considered “feminine.”
The implication for me is that because I have a body that other people read as female but don’t identify as feminine, I’m just not in touch with my inner goddess.
The implication for trans and non-binary people in general is that since they don’t identify with the “energy” their bodies supposedly contain, they’re not being their true selves.
This is a perfect way to claim authority about everyone’s gender: If they think they’re not the gender that “matches” their bodies, they’re just repressed. That’s super invalidating to those who are actually being themselves by being gender-nonconforming.
In reality, your body can mean whatever you want it to mean. The power of certain bodies to give birth is beautiful, but your uterus doesn’t have to be a nurturer of life and your breasts don’t have to symbolize your potential as a caretaker or erotic object – they can just be there with no meaning at all.
Your vagina doesn’t have to indicate how receptive and passive you are. It can show you’re fierce, and active, and literally able to engulf someone – or, once again, mean nothing at all.
It’s okay to employ this symbolism as long as we understand it’s not objective. You can assign whatever symbolism you want to a body, and making a body read as female out to be “feminine” is just one possibility.
2. It Promotes the Idea That There’s an Objective Definition of Femininity and Masculinity
I once mentioned to a friend that aggression is part of our culture’s definition of masculinity, and he responded that the real definition of masculinity is assertiveness.
You hear this a lot: “True masculinity is showing vulnerability. Real men respect women. Femininity actually is powerful.”
While these are seemingly more positive definitions of masculinity and femininity, we shouldn’t be defining masculinity or femininity at all.
When we talk about masculine and feminine energies, we’re usually implying that while certain cultures and unique individuals may see these genders a certain way, there’s also an objective way to see them. As the above examples illustrate, we may even contrast cultures’ definitions of gender with their “true” definitions.",feminism,FAVOR,

Pro-life Americans can rally behind Friday’s executive action that should stop Title X funding going to Planned Parenthood for abortions! We received word from the White House that President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services is filing a proposal to protect life in the Title X Family Planning Grant Program. HHS will file with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposal to update the regulations governing the Title X program to ensure compliance with the program’s statutory prohibition on taxpayer funding of programs where abortion is a method of family planning.
There are 266 Planned Parenthood facilities which currently provide both chemical and surgical abortions in the same place as family planning services. Similar to the Reagan-era framework, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, the new proposal would require a “bright line of physical as well as financial separation between Title X Programs and any program or facility where abortion is performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning.” It will prohibit counseling for abortion, but not counseling about abortion. It will better protect victims of sexual assault, incest, and rape by requiring documentation of compliance with state reporting laws regarding potential victims.
Please thank President Trump for this significant move toward defunding Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood performs 300,000 abortions a year, and is now reported to be moving into actions to “change” gender which ultimately permanently sterilize and otherwise mutilate healthy bodies.

COLUMBUS (AP) — A Cincinnati anti-abortion activist was in regular contact with Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine’s office during a 2015 Planned Parenthood investigation and some of her input was shared with state investigators, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.
The records shed new light on the internal handling of an investigation DeWine launched in response to a secretly taped video that appeared to show Planned Parenthood employees engaged in potentially illegal fetal tissue sales.
DeWine, an abortion opponent and gubernatorial candidate, ultimately found no such tissue sales by the abortion provider, but raised concerns about Planned Parenthood’s disposal of fetal remains that he said had to be addressed.
The documents show Paula Westwood, executive director of Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati, emailed DeWine’s community liaison detailed suggestions for carrying out the probe, including names, addresses and a lawyer to consult.
The liaison, Richard D. “Dee” Weghorst, forwarded some of Westwood’s communications to senior staff members, including chief of staff Mary Mertz, chief counsel Sheryl Creed Maxfield and then-policy director Ryan Stubenrauch, who’s now the spokesman for DeWine’s gubernatorial campaign.
Also, Robert Schmansky, a lawyer involved in the investigation, reported to Maxfield in an Aug. 10, 2015, email that he’d spoken with Westwood by phone. He said she passed along two tips regarding the relationship between Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and alleged stem-cell research at the hospital using fetal tissues.
Schmansky noted that Westwood “conceded that she has no direct information,” but told Maxfield: “I will follow-up with Pete (Thomas, chief of the Charitable Law Section) on how we might incorporate any of this information into our investigation.”
Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, said state investigations need to be impartial and appearing to give special access to those with a particular political ideology is potentially problematic for DeWine.
“It is easier to understand a quid pro quo of a financial situation than with making investigative decisions based on ideology and your cozy relationships, but it’s still a conflict of interest,” she said.
Westwood said in an interview that she did not know Maxfield and could not recall ever speaking with Schmansky on the phone. She said Weghorst is her organization’s regional contact at the office.
“There is a concern that there may be some activity going on that is shady and, essentially, it was ‘Have you looked into this? This may be a possibility.’ That’s about it,” Westwood said. “I would say, as any citizen can, these are our public officials and we can ask these questions. I see their office as (a place) both Right to Life and Planned Parenthood can access for information or to ask them to look into certain things.”

Hanging women who have an abortion is not pro-life,"Kevin Williamson wasn't fired by 'The Atlantic' for being anti-abortion or having 'mainstream' conservative views. He was fired for wanting women to suffer.
Is it out of bounds to argue that women should be hanged for having an abortion?
An actual debate is raging over this question following yesterday’s firing of conservative writer Kevin Williamson from The Atlantic for expressing this view on multiple occasions. Williamson apparently believes this is “pro-life.”
Conservatives fanned out to attack The Atlantic and “the Left” for their closed- mindedness in not embracing a view that calls for the humiliating, torturous killing by the state of women who have had an abortion.
Commentary’s Noah Rothman called Williamson’s firing “chilling” and The Resurgent’s Eric Erickson said that it was all “about the left wanting a monopoly on the public square so none can be exposed to competing ideas.” The American Conservative’s Rod Dreher tweeted, “The Atlantic's cutting [Williamson] loose under left-wing fire is deplorable. But clarifying. Definitely clarifying.”
Reason’s Katherine Mangu-Ward wrote, “The Atlantic is essentially declaring that it cannot stomach real, mainstream conservatism as it actually exists in 21st century America.”
More: CNN, journalists should have no pity for anonymous internet trolls
Here is Williamson’s view as expressed in a podcast: “I would totally go with treating [abortion] like any other crime up to and including hanging -- which kind of, as I said, I’m kind of squishy about capital punishment in general, but I’ve got a soft spot for hanging as a form of capital punishment. I tend to think that things like lethal injection are a little too antiseptic.”
“I’ve got a soft spot for hanging.”
Little Green Footballs’ Charles Taylor hit the nail on the head in a Twitter debate with Williamson about his view: “You don’t just want these women to die, you want them to suffer.”
But according to Williamson’s defenders, this is just another viewpoint like, say, believing in supply-side economics or that the government is too big. It’s “mainstream conservativism,” apparently.
Except it’s not. It’s not even mainstream among conservative anti-abortion rights organizations. When candidate Donald Trump said in an interview that he thought women should be punished for abortions, the rebukes were swift and mighty. The March for Life put out a statement saying, “No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about.” The National Right to Life Committee also released a statement making clear that it has never supported penalties against women who undergo abortions. Trump was forced to reverse his position to say that should abortion be outlawed, the only person who would be held accountable would be the doctor, not the woman. Even Trump didn’t gleefully muse about hanging people.
Williamson seems to believe his way of thinking is merely the intellectually consistent view. He says abortion is murder, and murderers (sometimes) get the death penalty — though typically not by hanging, unless you live under the Taliban — ergo women who have abortions should get the death penalty. Easy peasy. Yet the Catholic Church, of which Williamson is a member, has somehow managed to be opposed to both abortion and the death penalty.
Where I find common cause with Williamson’s defenders is in their concern that intellectual diversity is lacking in our society’s cultural institutions whether it’s the media or academia. In fact, I wrote an entire book on the topic. I just don’t think this event is a good example of that phenomenon.
While we should afford wide latitude for what people can say in public without fear of sanction in an effort to encourage vigorous debate, no publication is obligated to hire people who express views that violate their ethos. For example, is anyone criticizing the National Review for not having a marquee pro-abortion rights liberal columnist, let alone one who is making an argument that is outside the farthest fringe of what abortion rights organizations support?

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
It is nonsensical to say that the firing of Williamson proves the Atlantic can’t tolerate ideological differences. The Atlantic is a center-left publication, yet they hired Williamson knowing he was an articulate conservative who opposes abortion rights.
What the Atlantic didn’t know was the callousness and inhumanity with which Williamson discusses women who’ve had an abortion.
To suggest, as many have, that he was fired for being “pro-life” is ridiculous. He was fired for being unable to have a reasoned, civil debate about abortion that doesn’t involve fantasizing not just about the government killing women who get abortions, but about how they kill them.

The Boulder Valley Women’s Health Center, which has two locations in Longmont and Boulder, receives about $500,000 each year in funding through Title X, a federal grant program dedicated to providing family planning services as well as preventative health services.
If enacted, health care providers would not be allowed to perform abortions or refer patients to clinics for abortions if they want to continue to receive Title X funding.
News of the proposed rule was released on May 22, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officially released its notice of proposed rulemaking on Tuesday. The notice is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Friday to begin the official open comment period.

“Boys Don’t Cry” director Kimberly Peirce came on board in 2017 to helm “This Is Jane,” set up at John Lesher’s Le Grisbi Productions. Lesher and Peter Heller are producing.
The project is based on Laura Kaplan’s book “The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service,” which follows women who provided abortion services in the years before 1973’s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Kaplan, who joined the three-year-old organization Jane in 1971, assembled the histories of the anonymous women who are identified only by pseudonyms.
Williams will play Jane founder’s, known as Jenny. The actress has been nominated for Academy Awards for “Brokeback Mountain,” “Blue Valentine,” “My Week With Marilyn,” and “Manchester by the Sea.” She recently starred in “All the Money in the World” and in Amy’s Schumer’s “I Feel Pretty,” and will next be seen opposite Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed in Sony’s “Venom,” which opens Oct. 5.
Peirce’s feature directing credits include “Stop-Loss” and 2013’s remake of “Carrie.” Williams is repped by WME, Brillstein Entertainment, and Bloom, Hergott. The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.",abortion,NONE,"probably favor, but not evident from text"

Marshall firmly believes that incest can be voluntary, and shouldn’t be a reason to get an abortion. He made this statement in an interview in 1989.
Over the years, Marshall has made clear his position on what he thinks of abortion. He has introduced many personhood bills, intended to ensure that a fetus is given the same rights as a living person from the moment of conception in his state.
Marshall also introduced the controversial trans-vaginal ultrasound bill, that demands that a woman should go for invasive ultrasounds before having an abortion.
According to RightWingWatch,iIn 2010, he said, “Nature takes its vengeance on subsequent children. It’s a special punishment, Christians would suggest.”

This undercover footage was taken during the annual conventions of the National Abortion Federation in 2014 and 2015, and perhaps the most disturbing moment is when one abortionist jokes about an eyeball rolling into her lap. All of the undercover videos that have been released by the Center For Medical Progress are very startling and very graphic, but it is absolutely imperative that the American people be told the truth about what is actually happening in these abortion clinics. If these crimes against humanity do not stop, there is no hope and no future for our nation.
Defunding Planned Parenthood is “not just another political issue”, and we can no longer afford to elect politicians that use the “Pro-Life” label to get votes but then continue to vote to fund Planned Parenthood once they take office.
Every single day precious little babies are being ripped limb from limb and their body parts are being sold off for profit.
And the new undercover video that was recently released shows some of these abortionists actually making jokes about what they are doing…
The Center For Medical Progress released a new undercover video showing Planned Parenthood executives discussing gruesome abortion procedures and the sale of fetal body parts for profit. The video was filmed at the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings of the National Abortion Federation.
The new undercover video appears to be a preview of a longer project, and is a compilation of comments made by Planned Parenthood executives and other abortion supporters at the NAF conventions. During conversations and panel discussions, the PP executives make stunning comments about abortion procedures.
Several attendees made jokes about eyeballs and other fetal body parts “rolling down into their laps.” Others laughed as they discussed how hard it is to remove the unborn baby’s head from the womb.
You can view the entire video from the Center For Medical Progress on YouTube right here.
It is time for the Pro-Life community to stand up and tell our politicians that defunding Planned Parenthood is no longer optional.
If they will not pledge to vote against every single bill that includes even a single penny of funding for Planned Parenthood, they will not get our votes.
How much more do we have to see before we are willing to take a stand? The following summary of the undercover videos that the Center For Medical Progress has released so far comes from LifeNews.com…
In the first video: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
In the second video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, “I want a Lamborghini” as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.
In the third video: Holly O’Donnell, a former Stem Express employee who worked inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, detailed first-hand the unspeakable atrocities and how she fainted in horror over handling baby legs.
In the fourth video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Savita Ginde stated, “We don’t want to do just a flat-fee (per baby) of like, $200. A per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.” She also laughed while looking at a plate of fetal kidneys that were “good to go.”
In the fifth video: Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood-Gulf Coast in Houston boasted of Planned Parenthood’s skill in obtaining “intact fetal cadavers” and how her “research” department “contributes so much to the bottom line of our organization here, you know we’re one of the largest affiliates, our Research Department is the largest in the United States.”
In the sixth video: Holly O’Donnell described technicians taking fetal parts without patient consent: “There were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don’t know. And there’s no way they would know.”
In the seventh and perhaps most disturbing video: Holly O’Donnell described the harvesting, or “procurement,” of organs from a nearly intact late-term fetus aborted at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s Alameda clinic in San Jose, CA. “‘You want to see something kind of cool,’” O’Donnell says her supervisor asked her. “And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating. And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.”
In the eighth video: StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer admits Planned Parenthood sells “a lot of” fully intact aborted babies.
The ninth video: catches a Planned Parenthood medical director discussing how the abortion company sells fully intact aborted babies — including one who “just fell out” of the womb.
The 10th video: catches the nation’s biggest abortion business selling specific body parts — including the heart, eyes and “gonads” of unborn babies. The video also shows the shocking ways in which Planned Parenthood officials admit that they are breaking federal law by selling aborted baby body parts for profit.
Unreleased Videos: Unreleased videos from CMP show Deb Vanderhei of Planned Parenthood caught on tape talking about how Planned Parenthood abortion business affiliates may “want to increase revenue [from selling baby parts] but we can’t stop them…” Another video has a woman talking about the “financial incentives” of selling aborted baby body parts.
The 11th video: catches a Texas Planned Parenthood abortionist planning to sell the intact heads of aborted babies for research. Amna Dermish is caught on tape describing an illegal partial-birth abortion procedure to terminate living, late-term unborn babies which she hopes will yield intact fetal heads for brain harvesting.
The 12th video in the series shows new footage of Jennefer Russo, medical director at Planned Parenthood in Orange County, California, describing to undercover investigators how her abortion business tries to harvest intact aborted babies’ bodies for a local for-profit biotech company and changes the abortion procedure to do so.
The 13th video: exposes a Planned Parenthood medical director admitting that babies born alive after abortion are sometimes killed.
As I stated yesterday, I greatly applaud President Trump for proposing a budget that would completely defund Planned Parenthood.
Unfortunately, his budget is not going to get through Congress.
There are several Republican senators that are against defunding Planned Parenthood, and we need to make it clear to them that such a stance is no longer acceptable.
In particular, senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are threatening to hold up the effort to repeal Obamacare over this issue. The following comes from the Hill…
And with majorities in the House and Senate and control of the White House, the goal seems within reach after years of the party being thwarted by Senate Democrats and former President Barack Obama.
The problem is that Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) both may oppose a healthcare bill that cuts off funding to Planned Parenthood.
Collins is not up for re-election until 2020, and Murkowski is not up for re-election until 2022. But one pro-Planned Parenthood senator that we can remove from Congress in 2018 is Dean Heller of Nevada…
Forcing a fight over Planned Parenthood would also put a focus on Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who is up for reelection in 2018 in a state won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Heller sparked criticism from both conservatives and liberals after he said at a recent town hall that he has “no problem” with federal funding for Planned Parenthood and would “protect” it.
Because he is in favor of funding Planned Parenthood, Heller has forfeited any future support from Pro-Life conservatives.
So we need a Senate candidate in Nevada for 2018. I know that there are a lot of good Pro-Life people that live in the state, and if you are thinking of running for that seat please feel free to reach out to me.
For decades Pro-Life activists have been writing letters, holding marches and trying to make our voices heard, but the politicians have been ignoring us.
Now it is time for us to rise up and demand that they listen to us by denying our votes to any politician that will not vote to defund Planned Parenthood every single time.
Nearly 60 million children have already died, and many more will die this year.
If we are not willing to take action now, when will we ever be?

209,http://www.dailywire.com/news/22368/abortion-activist-blocks-ben-shapiro-twitter-after-james-barrett,Shapiro Dismantles Pro-Abortion Author's Argument. What Happens Next Is Hilarious.,"On Tuesday, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro thoroughly dismantled a pro-abortion thought experiment posted by comic and author Patrick S. Tomlinson that went viral on Twitter. In response, Tomlinson tried to dismiss Shapiro's reasoned, meticulous response by vaguely saying Shapiro somehow ""missed the point"" — ironically proving that Tomlinson actually ""missed the point"" of the entire debate — and then, predictably, Tomlinson blocked Shapiro.
In a series of tweets posted Monday, Tomlinson lays out a thought experiment that he claims ""destroys"" pro-lifers' argument that ""life begins at conception."" Tomlinson claims that in ""ten years"" of presenting this thought experiment to those who want to protect unborn lives, ""no one has EVER answered it honestly."" Here's Tomlinson's entire thread in paragraph form:
Whenever abortion comes up, I have a question I've been asking for ten years now of the ""Life begins at Conception"" crowd. In ten years, no one has EVER answered it honestly. It's a simple scenario with two outcomes. No one ever wants to pick one, because the correct answer destroys their argument. And there IS a correct answer, which is why the pro-life crowd hates the question.
Here it is. You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled ""1000 Viable Human Embryos."" The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other, but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die, saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no ""C."" ""C"" means you all die.
In a decade of arguing with anti-abortion people about the definition of human life, I have never gotten a single straight A or B answer to this question. And I never will. They will never answer honestly, because we all instinctively understand the right answer is ""A."" A human child is worth more than a thousand embryos. Or ten thousand. Or a million. Because they are not the same, not morally, not ethically, not biologically. This question absolutely evicerates (sic) their arguments, and their refusal to answer confirms that they know it to be true.
No one, anywhere, actually believes an embryo is equivalent to a child. That person does not exist. They are lying to you. They are lying to you to try and evoke an emotional response, a paternal response, using false-equivalency. No one believes life begins at conception. No one believes embryos are babies, or children. Those who cliam (sic) to are trying to manipulate you so they can control women. Don't let them. Use this question to call them out. Reveal them for what they are. Demand they answer your question, and when they don't, slap that big ol' Scarlet P of the Patriarchy on them. The end.
The 1964-65 New York World's Fair closes after a two-year run. More than 51 million people had attended the event.
Albert Einstein flees Nazi Germany and moves to the United States.
In a response published on Daily Wire, Shapiro demonstrates that Tomlinson's supposedly pro-life ""eviscerating"" argument is fundamentally flawed.
""Let’s put aside Tomlinson’s obvious douchiness; the commenters on the Twitter thread are properly puzzled,"" writes Shapiro. ""That’s because Tomlinson is correct that we all have a moral instinct: to save the five-year-old. But he’s wrong if he thinks the hypothetical proves that embryos aren’t human life or potential human life, and therefore of no value.""
Shapiro, who answers directly that he would and should save the 5-year-old child's life, lays out four reasons that Tomlinson's supposedly original thought experiment, while ""interesting,"" is ultimately worthless. Shapiro argues that 1) ""moral instinct does not always mean correct moral decisionmaking""; 2) the pro-abortion thought experiment ""does not reveal the value of embryonic life""; 3) ""most pro-lifers freely admit the supreme value of already-born human life, but that doesn’t make prenatal life valueless""; and 4) the whole thought experiment simply isn't reality: ""the case of pro-abortion advocates isn’t a choice between a five-year-old and a thousand fetuses. It’s a case of killing a fetus, by itself."" (Read Shapiro's full rebuttal here.)
After claiming to have gotten ""another thousand"" followers by the time he woke up Tuesday morning, Tomlinson eventually saw Shapiro's rebuttal and tweeted, ""Watch @benshapiro prove the point while missing it entirely. It's really a sight to see,"" with a link to Shapiro's article.
Proving that he does not fully understand Shapiro's response or the implications of his own argument, Tomlinson responded to Shapiro's initial tweet of his article by writing, ""Exactly. You would save the 5 yr old. Thank you for proving the point.""
The responses online to Tomlinson's claim that Shapiro somehow proved his point was brutal, with even pro-abortion followers slamming Tomlinson for failing to understand the discussion he had started. At first Tomlinson replied but then quickly disappeared:
Tomlinson went on to block Shapiro on Twitter.

Republicans Should Listen,"Rachel Goldberg and her husband were told her blood work was fine at 16 weeks of pregnancy in 2015. This was her first pregnancy, so she didn't think anything of it when the tech asked about the blood work results during her 20-week ultrasound. She and her husband were just excited to get the pictures so they could tell their friends about the pregnancy. Then the tech called the doctor in, who told Rachel she was seeing abnormalities in the fetus and referred her to a specialist.
""I just remember just kind of staring at her, because I really just don’t remember having any cohesive thoughts; I just didn’t know what that meant,"" Rachel says in an interview with Elite Daily.
After seeing a specialist for an intensive ultrasound and an amniocentesis, Rachel was told her baby wasn't developing properly.
""Our doctor said that he wasn’t sure [the baby] would survive, and [the doctor] wasn’t sure that even if he did survive that one of the surgeries he would need wouldn’t kill him, and even if he did survive birth and then multiple surgeries, he wasn’t sure if all of his organs would be connected or what kind of quality of life he would have or anything like that,"" she says.
""It became very obvious that even if [the baby] lived, he would clearly suffer, and the only reason we would continue the pregnancy is because we really wanted a baby, not because he would have a good quality of life. We decided that we really couldn’t ask him to suffer for our needs.""
Meanwhile, the pregnancy was high-risk to Rachel's own medical safety.
""I didn’t want my husband to lose his child and his wife on the same day, so we decided to get an abortion,"" she says.
These are the decisions Republicans in Congress are trying to prevent.
Washington Post on YouTube
This week, House Republicans proposed and passed a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. A similar bill is now in the Senate. It does not look like the Senate will be able to pass it — it would need 60 votes to pass, and there are only 52 Republicans in the Senate. Senators are expected to vote largely along party lines.
But the message the proposal sends is clear, and it's harmful, and it's cruel.
""What does that say to the average American at home?"" asks Dr. Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor in obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, in an interview with Elite Daily. ""To someone who doesn't work with these women and see what it’s actually like in real life … this is really deceiving.""
The Republicans are calling their bill the ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,"" arguing that fetuses after 20 weeks' gestation can feel pain. This is a myth as actual research, such as a report from the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association, shows. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also notes that science does not support the fetal pain argument.
""In reality, it’s not based in science, and that’s really misleading to the American public,"" Conti says.
The House Republicans aren't doing this because of reality. They're doing this to push an anti-abortion agenda in any way possible.
The reality is that only 1.3 percent of all abortions in the United States happen after 21 weeks' gestation, according to the Center for Disease Control's latest report from 2013.
Throughout pregnancy, a woman must be able to make decisions best for her circumstances, without politicians interfering. #NoAbortionBan
— All* Above All (@AllAboveAll) October 2, 2017
""They're happening for a variety of reason that oftentimes are emotionally charged or medically complicated,"" Conti says.
""The most common reason I see is for genetic or fetal abnormalities,"" Dr. Anuj Khattar, a family medicine specialist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, tells me. This includes fetuses that are missing a brain or internal organs as well as those with cardiac abnormalities and lethal genetic issues. ""Oftentimes [these issues are] not discovered until those ultrasounds that occur around 18-21 weeks.""
There are also social reasons why a woman would seek an abortion after 20 weeks. Khattar had a patient a few weeks ago, for instance, who wasn't able to get to a clinic because she was in an abusive relationship and her boyfriend wouldn't let her go. She was finally able to see Khattar for a procedure after her boyfriend was put in jail. She was past 20 weeks.
According to Khattar, there have been patients who lost their job and health insurance, there are patients who didn't know they were pregnant, and there are patients using substances who realized they were not in a place to be a parent.
Then you have to consider the legal blockades. States across the country have been passing laws to make it more difficult for women to obtain the medical procedure of an abortion — making it more time-consuming, further away, more expensive, and so forth. After anti-abortion laws were passed in Texas, for instance, women in Dallas were delayed as long as 20 days for an initial consultation in 2015, according to a report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project.
""Our society isn’t really created with people to have the best access to health care, and unfortunately people get delayed in ways you don’t want or expect,"" Khattar says.
Rachel and her husband were blocked by laws as well.
She didn't meet the requirements for an exception to get an abortion after 20 weeks under Missouri law, where they lived. So they had to drive to Colorado for the procedure. The doctor they saw there — one of the few in America who provides abortion at that point in a pregnancy — wasn't in her insurance network, and her insurance company refused to cover the cost of the procedure, which was $10,000. Rachel and her husband had to take out a loan to pay for it.
""I have a place of privilege, I come from a middle class family, I’m white, I’m able to get a bank loan, my husband and I work, and it was hard enough for us to obtain an abortion when we needed one,"" she says. ""I can't imagine what it would be like for people who don’t have those resources.""
Rachel chose to tell her story when Missouri started debating a ban on abortions after Down syndrome diagnoses. She has testified to state legislature about her experience and shared her story with the 1 in 3 Campaign. That proposal made her angry, just as the GOP's current federal proposal makes her angry.
""Abortions done this late in pregnancy are for severe medical reasons, or because the mother couldn’t raise the money in time to get an early abortion, or there’s domestic violence, or things like that going on,"" she says. ""To use these kinds of abortions to score points is just ridiculous.""
There is a happy ending here: Rachel gave birth to a boy in August.
""My living son would not be here if I wasn’t able to have an abortion, and I probably wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have that choice,"" she says. ""It’s just frustrating that my health care is being used as a political weapon, and that’s all it is.""",abortion,FAVOR,
249,http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals/,Neoliberalism Has Conned Us Into Fighting Climate Change as Individuals,"Would you advise someone to flap towels in a burning house? To bring a flyswatter to a gunfight? Yet the counsel we hear on climate change could scarcely be more out of sync with the nature of the crisis.
The email in my inbox last week offered thirty suggestions to green my office space: use reusable pens, redecorate with light colours, stop using the elevator.
Back at home, done huffing stairs, I could get on with other options: change my lightbulbs, buy local veggies, purchase eco-appliances, put a solar panel on my roof.
And a study released on Thursday claimed it had figured out the single best way to fight climate change: I could swear off ever having a child.
These pervasive exhortations to individual action — in corporate ads, school textbooks, and the campaigns of mainstream environmental groups, especially in the west — seem as natural as the air we breath. But we could hardly be worse-served.
While we busy ourselves greening our personal lives, fossil fuel corporations are rendering these efforts irrelevant. The breakdown of carbon emissions since 1988? A hundred companies alone are responsible for an astonishing 71 percent. You tinker with those pens or that panel; they go on torching the planet.
The freedom of these corporations to pollute – and the fixation on a feeble lifestyle response – is no accident. It is the result of an ideological war, waged over the last forty years, against the possibility of collective action. Devastatingly successful, it is not too late to reverse it.
The political project of neoliberalism, brought to ascendence by Thatcher and Reagan, has pursued two principal objectives. The first has been to dismantle any barriers to the exercise of unaccountable private power. The second had been to erect them to the exercise of any democratic public will.
Its trademark policies of privatization, deregulation, tax cuts and free trade deals: these have liberated corporations to accumulate enormous profits and treat the atmosphere like a sewage dump, and hamstrung our ability, through the instrument of the state, to plan for our collective welfare.
Anything resembling a collective check on corporate power has become a target of the elite: lobbying and corporate donations, hollowing out democracies, have obstructed green policies and kept fossil fuel subsidiesflowing; and the rights of associations like unions, the most effective means for workers to wield power together, have been undercut whenever possible.
At the very moment when climate change demands an unprecedented collective public response, neoliberal ideology stands in the way. Which is why, if we want to bring down emissions fast, we will need to overcome all of its free-market mantras: take railways and utilities and energy grids back into public control; regulate corporations to phase out fossil fuels; and raise taxes to pay for massive investment in climate-ready infrastructure and renewable energy — so that solar panels can go on everyone’s rooftop, not just on those who can afford it.
Neoliberalism has not merely ensured this agenda is politically unrealistic: it has also tried to make it culturally unthinkable. Its celebration of competitive self-interest and hyper-individualism, its stigmatization of compassion and solidarity, has frayed our collective bonds. It has spread, like an insidious anti-social toxin, what Margaret Thatcher preached: “there is no such thing as society.”
Studies show that people who have grown up under this era have indeed become more individualistic and consumerist. Steeped in a culture telling us to think of ourselves as consumers instead of citizens, as self-reliant instead of interdependent, is it any wonder we deal with a systemic issue by turning in droves to ineffectual, individual efforts? We are all Thatcher’s children.
Even before the advent of neoliberalism, the capitalist economy had thrived on people believing that being afflicted by the structural problems of an exploitative system – poverty, joblessness, poor health, lack of fulfillment – was in fact a personal deficiency.
Neoliberalism has taken this internalized self-blame and turbocharged it. It tells you that you should not merely feel guilt and shame if you can’t secure a good job, are deep in debt, and are too stressed or overworked for time with friends. You are now also responsible for bearing the burden of potential ecological collapse.
Of course we need people to consume less and innovate low-carbon alternatives – build sustainable farms, invent battery storages, spread zero-waste methods. But individual choices will most count when the economic system can provide viable, environmental options for everyone—not just an affluent or intrepid few.
If affordable mass transit isn’t available, people will commute with cars. If local organic food is too expensive, they won’t opt out of fossil fuel-intensive super-market chains. If cheap mass produced goods flow endlessly, they will buy and buy and buy. This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address climate change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and politics.
Eco-consumerism may expiate your guilt. But it’s only mass movements that have the power to alter the trajectory of the climate crisis. This requires of us first a resolute mental break from the spell cast by neoliberalism: to stop thinking like individuals.
The good news is that the impulse of humans to come together is inextinguishable – and the collective imagination is already making a political come-back. The climate justice movement is blocking pipelines, forcing the divestment of trillions of dollars, and winning support for 100% clean energy economies in cities and states across the world. New ties are being drawn to Black Lives Matter, immigrant and Indigenous rights, and fights for better wages. On the heels of such movements, political parties seem finally ready to defy neoliberal dogma.
None more so than Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Manifesto spelled out a redistributive project to address climate change: by publicly retooling the economy, and insisting that corporate oligarchs no longer run amok. The notion that the rich should pay their fair share to fund this transformation was considered laughable by the political and media class. Millions disagreed. Society, long said to be departed, is now back with a vengeance.
So grow some carrots and jump on a bike: it will make you happier and healthier. But it is time to stop obsessing with how personally green we live – and start collectively taking on corporate power.",climate,AGAINST,
239,http://www.defenddemocracy.press/trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement-the-socialist-solution-to-climate-change/,Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement: The socialist solution to climate change,"Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement is another in a growing list of actions that exemplify the thoroughly reactionary character of his administration.
Behind the pseudo-populist “America first” rhetoric of his speech on Thursday, which bore the unmistakable imprint of Trump’s fascistic chief of staff Stephen Bannon, is the assertion that nothing will be tolerated that places the semblance of restraint on the rapacious operations of the corporate and financial aristocracy. If the Earth is to be poisoned and burned as a result, so be it.
Trump’s domestic and international rivals seized on the occasion to posture as defenders of the environment. Editorials in the New York Times and Washington Post called Trump’s action “shortsighted” and “self-defeating.” In Europe, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement declaring that the agreement would not be renegotiated, and that “it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.”
Such criticisms, however, have far less to do with the actual issue of climate change, let alone serious measures to halt the warming of the Earth, than they do with the international and domestic conflicts between different factions of the ruling class. Led by Germany, the European powers are using Trump’s pullout from the Paris agreement to bolster a campaign aimed at asserting their independent economic and geostrategic interests amidst a growing transatlantic divide.
Domestically, the criticism of Trump’s actions intersects with deep conflicts within the ruling class, centered on issues of foreign policy. Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution sounded a general theme when she called the decision a “huge foreign policy blunder” that would undermine the global position of the United States. She worried, “Might China be looking to fill the leadership role that the United States is vacating?”
Climate change is a real threat that requires urgent action. It has been understood since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 1990 that global warming is a result of carbon emissions (primarily carbon dioxide and methane) into the Earth’s atmosphere from human industrial and agricultural activity. Since then, reports by scientific bodies have expressed the unanimous conclusion that catastrophic consequences can be avoided only through immediate and far-reaching measures.
The problems that were predicted nearly 30 years ago are already manifest. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record, going back 136 years, have occurred since 2001. Stronger heat waves and longer droughts have interfered with agricultural production around the world. The Amazon rainforests almost ignited on a mass scale in 1998, 2005 and 2007 due to drier and hotter weather. Sea levels have already begun to rise, caused by the warming of the oceans and the expansion of water that occurs when its temperature increases. This, in turn, has exacerbated the flooding that accompanies hurricanes and typhoons.
Coral bleaching—stress induced on coral by warmer ocean temperatures and higher oceanic acidity—has already killed off nearly half of the Great Barrier Reef, a key part of the planet’s food chain and general ecological balance. Glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland are poised to fall into the ocean, which would immediately raise sea levels and disrupt weather patterns worldwide. Animal species are dying off as habitats are suddenly changed or new diseases, which thrive in the warmer climates, are introduced.
The seriousness of the situation stands out starkly against the measures agreed by the capitalist powers. The Paris agreement, generally preceded with the word “landmark” when mentioned in the media, is, in fact, toothless. It consists of nonbinding promises with the stated goal of keeping the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, slightly more than twice the current level of warming.
At the time of its adoption in 2015, leading climate scientist James Hansen aptly characterized it as a “fraud” and a “fake.” That the Paris agreement has the support of major corporate giants, including energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, says everything about its true character.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which the Paris agreement replaced, was also inadequate, but it failed because the major capitalist powers, led by the United States, rejected its binding targets. Participating in negotiations in advance of the Paris accord, then-president Barack Obama, who liked to give flowery speeches on the danger of climate change, insisted that the United States could not be legally bound by any new climate agreement.
To seriously address climate change requires a major reorganization of economic life on a global scale. The framework of energy production has to be transitioned from one that uses fossil fuels to one that relies on renewable energy. This, in turn, requires an international effort, involving a massive influx of funding for infrastructure, the development of current technologies and the investigation of new ideas, rather than the squandering of trillions of dollars on war and the self-enrichment of the world’s billionaires.
The technology exists to solve these problems, while at the same time increasing the living standards and quality of life of the world’s population. However, it is not possible to do so within the framework of the capitalist system.
Efforts to address climate change come into conflict with the two basic contradictions of the world capitalist system: the contradiction between a global economy and the division of the world into rival nation-states, and the contradiction between socialized production and the subordination of economic life to the accumulation of private profit.
That humanity has come to the point where its actions have a far-reaching impact on global climate patterns is an expression of the enormous impact of the development of the productive forces. Yet these productive forces remain trapped within an outmoded and irrational socio-economic system. Their further development, on a rational and scientific basis, requires a complete reorganization of social relations.
The same contradictions of the capitalist system that prevent any serious measures to address climate change also produce imperialist war, which threatens the entire planet, and the growth of poverty, unemployment and social inequality. These contradictions are at the same time politically radicalizing workers around the world.
Like every other major problem confronting mankind, climate change is fundamentally a class question. It is the working class that will suffer the brunt of the impact of global warming. It is the working class that is objectively and increasingly defining itself as an international class. It is the working class whose social interests lie in the overthrow of capitalism, the abolition of private ownership of the means of production, and the establishment of an economic system based on the satisfaction of human need, including a safe and heathy environment.
The dangers posed by global warming can be addressed only through a political struggle by the international working class against the anarchic and backward capitalist mode of production. Only in this way can the world’s economy be rationally and scientifically reorganized and an environmental catastrophe averted. In short, the solution to climate change is socialism.

7 December 2016
A worrying effect of climate change has been discovered by scientists studying the world’s longest-living animal, the quahog clam.
Researchers examined growth rings on the shell of the edible mollusc, which can live for more than 500 years, to uncover details of a dramatic shift in the interaction between the North Atlantic Ocean and the atmosphere.
Before the industrial period began some 200 years ago, atmospheric fluctuations were caused by natural changes in the ocean, driven by volcanic eruptions and the sun’s radiation.

253,http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/10/climate-change-for-vulnerable-ppl/,Why Climate Change Is an Issue of Social Justice for Vulnerable People,"I’ve never doubted that climate change is happening – or that it’s primarily caused by human actions.
I remember learning about the Earth’s rising temperature in elementary school and how it’s caused by the increasing volume of gases, like carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere. And it terrifies me that even though I learned this over a decade ago, not nearly enough has been done to change or regulate how much of these toxic gases we release.
They are emitted primarily through our use of fossil fuels to produce energy for the household and for industry. They trap heat in the atmosphere, accounting for a number of disastrous effects on the planet that scientists collectively call climate change – effects such as a higher number of extreme weather events (floods, droughts, and hurricanes, for example), melting ice caps that contribute to rising sea levels and less salty seas, and the destruction of habitats that leads to species extinction.
All these effects make it unpleasant – and eventually impossible – for humans and other organisms to live on Earth.
But up until last year, when a study exposed the dangerous levels of lead in the water supply in Flint, Michigan, I never considered any environmental issue a “social justice” issue.
Although the elevated levels of lead in the water supply from the Flint River doesn’t directly cause the warming of the planet, the way Flint’s local government mishandled the situation got me thinking about the winners and losers in this system where the environment is valued only in economic dollar terms.
It also made me think about whether the situation would have been handled differently if Flint wasn’t comprised of majority Black and poor residents.
Human activity within a capitalist society has not been eco-conscious. Governments and large corporations put the Earth’s environment on the backburner in order to cut costs and cut corners for profits. This mindset preserves inequality, de-prioritizes climate change for short-term gains, and causes nonhuman and human suffering.
What’s even sadder is that I don’t have the privilege of always making eco-friendly consumption choices because they are often out of reach on my income, and the products I can afford are often affordable at the expense of the environment and humanity.
I once thought that if I did the right individual actions like recycle properly, remember to conserve electricity, take public transportation, support collective efforts to conserve wildlife, preserve natural spaces, and reduce carbon emissions, that it would be enough. But there is an entire system that deters us from properly caring for the coral reefs, our rivers, and ourselves.
And until we treat climate change as a social issue that is not a separate issue for environmentalists-only or as separate from social justice work, we are not addressing the full issue.
It is easy for many of us to consider our own activist work to be more important, more urgent, and more relevant to the concerns of the immediate generation. But climate change isn’t just a distant or separate problem affecting only future generations (who we do also have a social responsibility to care about). Rather, it’s an issue that has accelerated in severity within our lifetime and directly contributes to injustice in most facets of human life.
Here are three reasons why climate change needs to be framed as a social justice issue when we design policies to stop it.
1. Climate Change Is Caused by the People Who Are the Least Affected By It
There are many ways to measure which countries are most responsible for contributing to climate change, but they all tell us that the biggest contributors to climate change are not the same ones that are most vulnerable to climate change.
Although Small Island Developing States, like islands in the Caribbean, in the Pacific Ocean, and off the coast of Africa and Asia, account for 0.003 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, these islands are at risk of completely disappearing due to rising sea levels, which have already caused displacement of coastal communities.
Carbon dioxide emissions are also often a direct signifier of a country’s economic growth. And these wealthier countries are generally better equipped with the laws and infrastructure to handle weather emergencies, epidemic outbreaks, and climate-related loss of livelihoods that make poorer countries so vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
Countries closer to the equator already experience high heat temperatures closer to our bodies’ biophysical thresholds so that incremental rises in temperature are much more dangerous. Heat also increases the rise in transmission and incidence of airborne and waterborne diseases in the tropics – generating unpayable health costs as the majority of the world’s poorest people do not have health insurance coverage or access to financial products and services.
Climate change has also been correlated with increases in violence and conflict, especially in countries that are ethnically diverse.
In regions that are already unstable, heatwaves and droughts resulting from climate change threaten the supply of food and other resources, exacerbating conflict between already tense or opposing groups of people.
Scientists have also shown a positive relationship between rises in temperature and aggression across many different situations.
In fact, on September 21, the Obama Administration called on US governmental agencies to treat climate change as a threat to national security, recognizing that the effects of climate change “can stress some countries’ ability to provide the conditions necessary for human security. All of these effects can lead to population migration within and across international borders, spur crises, and amplify or accelerate conflict in countries or regions already facing instability and fragility.”
Yet these unequal distributions of negative impact from climate change aren’t very visible to citizens within the United States and other industrialized countries who do not bear the severest brunt of weather pattern changes. Additionally wealth inequality and poverty make it difficult to say no to expanding industries that release so much carbon into the atmosphere.
If we want to fight injustice, we must recognize at just how many levels it operates. We must be aware of just how intertwined our fights against oppression are and the convoluted way in which various forms of discrimination interact in social systems.
Climate change is not only unfair to nonhuman living creatures that have done nothing to cause it, but deeply unfair at the national level to countries with citizens who have to deal with its most acute consequences while receiving none of the profits – and as we’ll see, deeply unfair within already oppressed communities.

254,http://uproxx.com/news/white-house-drops-climate-change-national-security-threat/,The White House Will Reportedly Drop Climate Change From The National Security Threat List,"President Trump is set to announce his new (even Russia-friendlier) national security strategy this week. While the strategy’s hard stance toward China is making headlines, another change could have even bigger implications for the future. According to reports, the U.S. will officially remove climate change from the list of national security threats in the doctrine.
In yet another complete shift away from Barack Obama’s policies, the strategy appears like another instance of the Trump administration ignoring the realities of climate change — after a first year in office marked by a number of calamitous natural disasters. From the New York Times:
The document instead places climate under a section on embracing “energy dominance,” and says that while “climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,” American leadership will be “indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda.”
That puts it at odds with the Pentagon, which has continued to highlight national security threats from a changing climate, including refugee flows as a result of droughts and intensifying storms and the repercussions of rising sea waters.
Climate change was added to the country’s national security strategy doctrine in 2015. The updated doctrine will instead focus on economic competition and securing the nation’s borders as part of Trump’s ongoing “America First” strategy.",climate,FAVOR,

Rev. Daniel Sinaga, cited the Lutheran World Federation watchword ""Creation – not for sale"" adopted at its assembly held once every seven years and held this year during May in Windhoek, Namibia.
This is a call for climate justice in Indonesia which like other forested countries has many tens of thousands of square kilometres of forestland threatened with culling for trade, which can heavily impact climate systems.
A ""cycling for the climate"" initiative, which he launched with other youth in the Protestant Christian Batak Church (HKPB) saw participation grow from five regular bicycle users to 50 in just one year, Lutheran World Federation reports.
Sinaga considers this ""a very good and positive response about the project and the concern of climate change.""
This is also because owning a bicycle is an expensive investment for those taking part, mainly college students of the HKBP theological seminary in Pemantang Siantar city, North Sumatra.
""We aimed for the young people, especially theological seminary students, to inspire them about climate change concerns by using bicycles,"" Sinaga said.
""We hope they will be role models for other young people,"" says the 30-year-old pastor.
The Lutheran World Federation launched the Global Young Reformers Network of which Sinaga is a member in 2014, with the goal to encourage more young people to contribute to the life of LWF churches.
It also meshes with commemorating 500 years of the Reformation in 2017.
Working with bicycle clubs, Sinaga organized bike trips around the city to get people thinking about climate change.
""Everyone joined the one-day campaign. At the end, there were 50 participants who came with their bikes for our campaign 'cycling for the climate',"" he says of the main event, held near the seminary, which has around 600 students.
With a population of almost 260 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country.
The United Nations says that over the last decade energy demand rose at almost five percent annually.
Globally, such statistics have motivated youth to get involved in climate justice. Many look to cycling, rather than means of travel that burn fossil fuels, as a green mode of transportation.",climate,FAVOR,

Just this week alone, President Trump wisely pulled America out of the economy crippling Paris Accord, which would have done nothing to affect the climate, but killed countless jobs in the U.S.
Then, Wednesday gifted us another shocker!
We now find that NASA just revealed the results of a thorough study on West Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, which was originally thought to be bleeding off ice at an alarming rate. Had other more aggressive models been accurate, the world’s sea levels would have risen by 1%, a significant margin from a global perspective.
A NASA Study Shows Thwaites Glacier’s Ice Loss May Not Progress as Quickly as Thought
The melt rate of West Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier is an important concern, because this glacier alone is currently responsible for about 1 percent of global sea level rise. A new NASA study finds that Thwaites’ ice loss will continue, but not quite as rapidly as previous studies have estimated.
The new study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, finds that numerical models used in previous studies have overestimated how rapidly ocean water is able to melt the glacier from below, leading them to overestimate the glacier’s total ice loss over the next 50 years by about 7 percent.
Thwaites Glacier covers an area nearly as large as the state of Washington (70,000 square miles, or 182,000 square kilometers). Satellite measurements show that its rate of ice loss has doubled since the 1990s. The glacier has the potential to add several inches to global sea levels.
The new study is led by Helene Seroussi, a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. It is the first to combine two computer models, one of the Antarctic ice sheet and one of the Southern Ocean, in such a way that the models interact and evolve together throughout an experiment — creating what scientists call a coupled model.
Previous modeling studies of the glacier used only an ice sheet model, with the effects of the ocean specified beforehand and unchanging.
This is where the dishonesty is exposed. The global warming disciples will design models which favor results supporting their world view.
Seroussi and colleagues at JPL and the University of California at Irvine (UCI) used an ocean model developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge with an ice sheet model developed at JPL and UCI. They used data from NASA’s Operation Icebridge and other airborne and satellite observations, both to set up the numerical model simulations and to check how well the models reproduced observed changes.
Glaciers have beds just as rivers do, and most glacier beds slope downhill in the same direction the glacier is flowing, as a riverbed does. Thwaites Glacier’s bed does the opposite: it slopes uphill in the direction of flow. The bedrock under the glacier’s ocean front is higher than bedrock farther inland, which has been pushed down over the millennia by its heavy burden of ice.
Thwaites has lost so much ice that it floats where it used to be attached to bedrock. That has opened a passageway underneath the glacier where ocean water can seep in.
In this part of Antarctica, the warm, salty, deep ocean current that circles the continent comes near land, and warm water can flow onto the continental shelf. This warm seawater now seeps beneath Thwaites Glacier, melting it from below.
As the glacier continues to melt, grow thinner and float off bedrock farther and farther inland, new cavities will continue to open up. Because the bedrock slopes downhill, there’s no natural barrier to stop this process. Earlier modeling studies assumed that water in the new cavities would continue to melt the glacial underside at the same rate that it’s melting now.
Seroussi’s coupled model found that water circulation is more restricted in these narrow spaces, and as a result, the water will melt the ice more slowly than previously thought.
Seroussi noted that critical factors affecting Thwaites, such as how nearby ocean temperatures will change, are still unknown and represented by different scenarios in different studies. However, “Our results shift the estimates for sea level rise to smaller numbers regardless of the scenario,” she said.
The study is titled “Continued retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, controlled by bed topography and ocean circulation.”
Pay Attention To How They Fudge Their Research
The dirty tricks of this Climate Change crowd have been exposed a long time ago, but we need to be reminded how dishonest they truly are, & how far they will go to gain control of our money to do whatever their dark hearts desire.
They will create a computer model designed to predict the absolute worst outcome for our climate, regardless of how inaccurate it will turn out to be.
So, we must turn the whole paradigm around on them & use wisdom of the ages to confound these fools. The most accurate way to predict the future, is to study the past. Look at all the climate patterns occurring throughout history, & use that to understand what’s next. They try to tell us that men’s activities are altering the patterns, but the numbers are not backing their claims.
We are finding, our planet is acting precisely the way it has been since men observed weather. Nothing that mankind is doing now will change this.
If volcanoes, which affect climate much more than men, cannot change Earth’s climate patterns or long term intensities, then we are powerless to compete with the world’s climactic clockwork…",climate,AGAINST,

Held at the Pir Mehar Ali Shah – Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, the seminar was part of a number of activities celebrating World Food Day, to raise awareness about climate change, food insecurity and the importance of agriculture and rural development.
The day’s activities were organised by the university, in collaboration with the Indus Consortium and Oxfam.
The day began with an awareness walk and tree plantation, attended by the university’s pro-vice chancellor, dean, directors, faculty members and students.
Participants also attended a seminar, which included a theatrical performance and a documentary screening.
Students performed a play that aimed to raise awareness about increasing food insecurity, while a short animated film and documentary produced by Oxfam highlighted the resilience of small-holder farmers in the face of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, as well as an increased frequency of flooding and drought.
Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Sarwar N Mirza said the event served as a reminder than Pakistan is an agriculture-based economy.
He said it was encouraging that jointly organised development initiatives by academia and the private sector were moving towards the cumulative agenda of development.
He asked young researchers to take the challenge of quality research and develop a vital link with rural communities, and come up with new climate resilient solutions.
Oxfam in Pakistan programmes director Javeria Afzal said: “Climate change and food insecurity across the world is impacting poor people’s access to healthy and nutritious food.
“In a world of plenty, many are forced to migrate to earn more to feed themselves and their dependents.”

244,http://ecosalon.com/we-cant-say-climate-change-anymore/,"Sorry, Folks: We Can’t Say ‘Climate Change’ Anymore","When we swapped out the term “global warming” for “climate change,” it was in an effort to be more precise with what exactly was happening with the planet. The same can’t be said for the USDA’s new directive to scrap mention of climate change in favor of “weather extremes.”
This new tendency, uncovered by The Guardian via a series of staff emails at the National Resources Conservation Service, is a clear departure from (correctly) placing blame on humans and the agriculture industry for changes in the world’s climate.
It all began in January, when Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS, wrote in an email to senior employees, “It has become clear one of the previous administration’s priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.”
Just a few weeks after, in mid-February, Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, listed several terms to be avoided in an email: not only was “climate change” to be replaced by “weather extremes,” but “climate change adaption” was to be swapped out for “resilience to weather extremes” and “reduce greenhouse gases” changed to “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.”
Not everyone was happy about the change. One NRCS employee wrote in a July 5 email that they would “prefer to keep the language as is” to maintain the “scientific integrity of the work,” and the NRDC, reporting on these changes, noted that the new euphemisms forced scientists to “lose any reference to a changing climate, greenhouse gases, and carbon pollution (and heat, it appears) and substitute them with fuzzy language that doesn’t convey the urgency of a global environmental, health, and social threat, nor agriculture’s role in it.”
Senators were also reasonably upset about the change, including Michigan Senator Debbie Stabelow, ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee.
“Censoring the agency’s scientists and natural resource professionals as they try to communicate these risks and help producers adapt to a changing climate does a great disservice to the men and women who grow the food, fuel, and fiber that drive our economy, not to mention the agency’s civil servants themselves,” Stabenow wrote to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “This censorship makes the United States less competitive, less food secure, and puts our rural families and their communities at risk.”
Reports of these changes with regard to language concerning climate change drew immediate repudiation from the USDA. Spokesman Tim Murtaugh denied the existence of such a directive, and for now, the NRCS website confirms this, retaining several mentions of climate change.
But this is only the latest way in which governmental talk of climate change has been dumbed down. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from government websites including those of the White House, the Department of the Interior, and the EPA. The government also announced in June that it would be withdrawing from the Paris agreement, due to the fact that the climate accord, which has been ratified by 159 parties around the world, is a “bad deal” for the United States.
Whatever we call it, climate change is a reality, as a recently leaked federal report drafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies confirms. The report, run by the New York Times earlier this month, places human activity at the center of these environmental issues, noting that the average temperatures in the United States have risen rapidly and drastically over the past 40 years to such an extent that even if changes are made now, the damage is irreversible.
“It directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited,” reports the Times.
“It’s a fraught situation,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geoscience and international affairs at Princeton University who was not involved in the study. “This is the first case in which an analysis of climate change of this scope has come up in the Trump administration, and scientists will be watching very carefully to see how they handle it.”
Of course, to handle it, we need to be able to talk about it. This is the impetus behind the suit of several government agencies, including the EPA, by the Center for Biological Diversity, in order to force them to release information on the “censoring” of climate change verbiage. According to Center open government attorney Meg Townsend, these modifications are tantamount to “active censorship of science” and “appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community.”

And in response to his announcement, many in corporate America, especially from over in Silicon Valley, publicly crucified the President as being someone who cares little about the environment, and of course, the future of our children.
But the greatest irony in all of this is that these same CEO’s who sought to be holier than thou in blaming Trump for crushing their dream of a green future, are the very same ones who have done little or nothing on their own to lower their carbon footprint, and instead show their great hypocrisy by blaming the government for not funding their liberal green agendas.
The irony of the “green” movement of US companies is that many of the firms that spend the most money and public relations effort trying to show the government, the public, and their shareholders that they are trying to improve the environment are also among the most prolific polluters in the country. Pollution does not mean that the companies are doing anything illegal. Instead, it simply refers to natural consequence of the companies’ industrial efforts which result in contamination to the air, soil or water by the discharge of substances that are toxic to the environment.
24/7 Wall St. has put together a list of the Top Ten Greenwashers in America. There may be some large companies that are greater polluters than these firms. There may be other corporations that do more to promote their pro-environment credentials. But those can be counted on two hands.
1) General Electric (GE)
2) American Electric Power (AEP)
3) ExxonMobil (XOM)
4) DuPont (DU)
5) Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)
6) Waste Management, Inc. (WMI)
7) International Paper (IP)
8) BP (BP)
9) Dow Chemical (DOW)
10) General Motors (GM) – 24/7 Wall Street
Of course we couldn’t write an article on the hypocrisy of the global warming movement without mentioning Hollywood, or perhaps the biggest hypocrite himself in Al Gore.
The bottom line is that domestic and multi-national corporations do not need the U.S. government to implement new regulations on cutting down carbon emissions or to move towards greener forms of alternative energy. And there is nothing stopping corporate America, Wall Street, or Silicon Valley from dipping into their own pockets to create the next green energy source, and the newest technologies that will not only improve life on this planet for the future, but satisfy their agendas to rid the world of that phantom monster called climate change.
But sadly, these paper billionaires never want to spend their own money, and to them if the taxpayers don’t foot the bill, then it must be time for the #hashtags to come out to blame Donald Trump for not falling in line behind their failed political agendas.
